While some people may see it as selfish or unnecessary to engage in such activities, others may find it to be a fulfilling and worthwhile experience.\nIt's important to note that engaging in risky sports always carries some level of risk, and individuals who choose to participate should be fully aware of the potential dangers and take all necessary precautions to minimize those risks. However, it's also important to recognize that risk is inherent in many aspects of life, and individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices regarding the level of risk they are willing to accept.\nThat being said, it's also important to consider the potential impact of one's actions on others. For example, extreme mountain climbing can require the assistance of a team of trained professionals, and putting oneself in danger can also put those professionals at risk. Additionally, engaging in risky sports can also have a psychological impact on loved ones who may be concerned for the individual's safety.\nOverall, the decision to pursue risky sports is a personal one, but it's important to weigh the potential risks and consider the impact on others before making that decision.\n"}]}, "cursorRange": "", "currentDoc": "", "currentCursor": 443, "currentSuggestions": [], "currentSuggestionIndex": 0, "currentHoverIndex": "", "currentN": "5", "currentMaxToken": "30", "currentTemperature": "0.9", "currentTopP": "1", "currentPresencePenalty": "0.5", "currentFrequencyPenalty": "0.5", "originalSuggestions": []}
