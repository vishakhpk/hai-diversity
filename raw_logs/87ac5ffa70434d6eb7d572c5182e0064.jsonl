For example, visual learners such as myself would have a hard time trying to listen to an audiobook whereas auditory learners would thrive in that environment.  There are also things in books that cannot be seen in audiobooks such as the structure or punctuation of novels which can add to the story depending on the author. While these are not the biggest components of novels and would not be missed by some, others enjoy the added symbolism that is sometimes included in this. \n\nPersonally, I find myself most engaged when reading and listening to the same book at the same time. This is mainly because I am a bit of a multitasker and therefore enjoy the interactions between both reading and listening. However, it is also because my mind frequently wanders, and having the audiobook to listen to helps me to stay focused.\n\nDespite this, listening to audiobooks does have its advantages. For example, you can multitask whilst you listen to an audiobook. Listeners can go on a walk, cook dinner, be driving their car, or do nearly any activity so long as they have a speaker or earbuds. Doing anything while you are reading a book is almost impossible given you have to be holding and looking at it while you are reading it. Therefore, listening to audiobooks is substantially more convenient than reading them. Especially for people who live busy lives.\n\nAnother benefit of listening to an audiobook is that you are more likely to be able to get through more books versus when an individual is just reading the hard copy version of a book. This is because, as earlier mentioned, it can be done while the listener is also doing something else. In this way, audiobooks can actually encourage readers/listeners to engage with more literature rather than just offer an alternative to picking up a book. \n\nAudiobooks also have the advantage of being more accessible. Thousands if not millions of audiobooks are available for free online whereas it can be difficult or impossible to get actual books for free. This allows those who would not otherwise read an opportunity to absorb literature. Audiobooks are also available anywhere so long as the listener has access to a phone or computer. But if you wanted to read a physical copy of a book the reader would need to have it with them.\n\nAlthough I do prefer reading because of the extras that audiobooks most certainly lack, I enjoy listening to audiobooks as well. Audiobooks certainly have their place in the modern world and give readers/listeners another option to continue their involvement with literature.\n"}]}, "cursorRange": "", "currentDoc": "", "currentCursor": 276, "currentSuggestions": [], "currentSuggestionIndex": 0, "currentHoverIndex": "", "currentN": "5", "currentMaxToken": "30", "currentTemperature": "0.9", "currentTopP": "1", "currentPresencePenalty": "0.5", "currentFrequencyPenalty": "0.5", "originalSuggestions": []}
