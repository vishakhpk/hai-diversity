I do not think I am the only one with this feeling as I have asked a couple of my friends about the same. Stereotypical characters make us all cringe because they just seem to be untouchable, infallible, or represent some sort of stereotype.\u00a0\n\nThe common stereotypes include religious, ethnic, national, occupational or lifestyle stereotypes. Imagine a high school movie where you have a handsome boy. He is the captain of the school basketball team, has a perfect body, and all ladies just want him to themselves. All of these attributes seem to be privileges but why will someone just have it all? Cringy, yea?\u00a0\n\nLet me paint another picture for you. Imagine an action packed movie but the main actor is untouchable. He can shoot and beat everyone but no \u201cbad guy\u201d can touch him. It can look fascinating at the start but it can be creepy with time. The least that should happen is the actor experiencing some scratches but still winning everyone eventually.\u00a0\n\nMy major detest for these stereotypical characters is because they make you think \u201clife is perfect.\u201d Sometimes, they make you think nature is not fair to you but to others. They paint some of us as less privileged if compared with other people. However, these characters do not exist in real life and are merely fictional - they only exist in these movies, books, and TV shows.\u00a0\n\nAbout watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal, there are different factors that may influence this decision. They include mood, storyline, other characters at play, Sometimes, you just want to explore something different and know what the \u201cdark side\u201d really looks like.\u00a0\n\nHowever, on a good day, I will say no to any content that glorifies or lauds offensive portrayal of another character. It just does not seem appalling to me. As a humanitarian, I cringe at some bad habits. There are some wrongdoings one might not be able to help but offensive acts are out of hand and if possible, they should be avoided.\n\nThe truth is that some characters can ruin the entire movie for you. Even in a normal movie that has few offensive scenes, it is so easy to see the entire movie in this light. You can remember King Joffrey or Ramsay Bolton in the book \u201cA book of Ice and Snow\u201d or the popular movie, Game of Thrones. Seeing them as better individuals is just a hilly mountain to climb if one is to consider how terrible their characters were.\u00a0\n\nIn conclusion, feeling cringe while seeing a movie, tv shows, or reading a book might be determined by other factors too and not the characters alone. But trust me, few people, if any, would appreciate stereotypical characters in these works. Similarly, offensive portrayals of characters can make anyone lose interest in a movie.\u00a0\n\n"}]}, "cursorRange": "", "currentDoc": "", "currentCursor": 236, "currentSuggestions": [], "currentSuggestionIndex": 0, "currentHoverIndex": "", "currentN": "5", "currentMaxToken": "30", "currentTemperature": "0.9", "currentTopP": "1", "currentPresencePenalty": "0.5", "currentFrequencyPenalty": "0.5", "originalSuggestions": []}
