Sports might mean something different to each person. But sports allow humans to push themselves to their physical limits and compete for victory. Even in solo sports like mountain climbing, we compete for something, whether personal best or the summit. Pursuing risky sports presents a way to challenge ourselves, build our confidence, and grow. Most sports present a danger to oneself, whether falling while climbing a mountain or gaining a concussion from a football game. The dangers that athletes face are vital as it provides obstacles to overcome and endure. Overall, risky sports allow people to grow, test themselves and experience the freedom and upper limits of humanity's physical and mental capabilities.\n\n\nSome may say, \"someone pursing risky sports is endangering themselves, and it is not fair to their family and friends if they end up maimed or dead.\" It would be hard to reject that an athlete dying would significantly burden their family and friends. However, think about the loss the athlete would take to their personal growth and development if they had never taken the risk. It would be as if you took the piano away from Mozart. Some parts of a person's life are well ingrained in their identity, and stripping them of that activity could be more damaging than the risk itself.\n\n\nTaking risks in your life is what pushes a human to greatness. Stagnation is not a desirable quality, and risky sports can draw out the potential in a person that they would never have achieved if they had stayed safe and protected. Humanity has progressed so far because of our willingness to take risks and explore the unknown. Athletes participating in extreme sports are the epitome of societies striving to reach and exceed our capabilities.\n\n\nIs there a line we draw where we say that a sport is unreasonable to perform? I think there is no line we could draw. Think of the man who flew a shuttle into low orbit, parachuted, and sky-dived from space back to the ground. Was it hazardous? Sure. But Felix Baumgartner, the Australian skydiver, accomplished a grand feat that no one thought was possible, and he used his own risk-taking attitude to persevere and achieve that incredible feat."}, {"delete": 15}]}, "cursorRange": "", "currentDoc": "", "currentCursor": 428, "currentSuggestions": [], "currentSuggestionIndex": 0, "currentHoverIndex": "", "currentN": "5", "currentMaxToken": "30", "currentTemperature": "0.9", "currentTopP": "1", "currentPresencePenalty": "0.5", "currentFrequencyPenalty": "0.5", "originalSuggestions": []}
