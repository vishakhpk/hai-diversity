Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, any physical activity can be called a sport, regardless of the level of risk involved. Many people would describe a risky sport as any event or pursuit that involves high speeds, heights, environmental factors, or overall risk. The simple matter of danger should not discount its validity as a sport. This is because extreme sports are still physically and mentally challenging, provide entertainment and spectator appeal, and should be classified as such because of personal freedom and individual choice.\u00a0\n\n\n\nExtreme sports are physically and mentally challenging. When a person engages in an activity such as snowboarding, mountain climbing, surfing, or any other high-intensity event, there is a great amount of intense training and athleticism involved. A participant in these activities needs to practice for many hours in often brutal conditions in order to perfect the skill. It is muscle-tearing, backbreaking work to become well adept at an extreme sport. In addition to physical factors, there are many mental aspects to consider. A person would have to be very focused and concentrated in order to successfully accomplish the task. They would need strategic thinking skills along with the mental strength required to overcome any fear or uncertainty. For these reasons, extreme activities should be qualified as sports.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAn important factor to consider when defining a sport is entertainment and spectator appeal. It can be argued that extreme sports have the most appeal out of all other events. The element of danger adds a layer of thrill and suspense for viewers that ordinary sports, such as soccer and baseball, do not. Sports events such as extreme skateboarding, snowboarding, and surfing often have incredibly large fan bases. This leads to the media having a large range of coverage and commercial interest. For this reason, extreme sports have increased the potential for high revenue and job opportunities. It can be argued that, due to the high-interest level associated with extreme activities, they should most definitely be considered sports.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn addition to the physical and mental demands along with the high level of spectator appeal, extreme activities should be considered sports simply because it is immoral for another person to say otherwise. There is a level of personal freedom and individual choice that goes along with any physical activity, especially extreme sports. How can another person tell an athlete that their passion is not a \"real\" sport? An individual should be allowed to follow their passion, explore their limits, and make their own choices. Not all sports should have to conform to a narrow definition. There is a great diversity of sports out there, and each of them appeals to an audience in a different way. It is important to embrace the nature of the sporting world and include all activities equally.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI believe that any physical activity can be called a sport, regardless of the level of risk involved. Just because an activity might seem risky or dangerous does not disqualify it from being called a sport. It is important for society to accept everyone's differences and embrace their interests and skills. Extreme activities should be considered sports because they are physically and mentally challenging, provide entertainment and spectator appeal, and should be classified as such because of personal freedom and individual choice. I encourage everyone to accept and appreciate diverse sporting disciplines.\u00a0\n"}]}, "cursorRange": "", "currentDoc": "", "currentCursor": 442, "currentSuggestions": [], "currentSuggestionIndex": 0, "currentHoverIndex": "", "currentN": "5", "currentMaxToken": "30", "currentTemperature": "0.9", "currentTopP": "1", "currentPresencePenalty": "0.5", "currentFrequencyPenalty": "0.5", "originalSuggestions": []}
