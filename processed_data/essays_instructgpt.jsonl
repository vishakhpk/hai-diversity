{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, this is a complicated question that doesn't necessarily have a clear answer. On the one hand, by staying informed about what's happening in the world, the citizenry are better equipped to police their own governments and be informed voters.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, it is not necessarily \"being bad citizens\" if we don't keep up with the news, but it certainly is a lost opportunity. If we don't keep up with the news, we are just ignoring what is happening around us which can be negative sometimes, but most of the times it is things that don't really matter to us or affect us. However, I do think that it is important for all people to have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world, as it can lead to a better atmosphere for everyone and the community. For example, you should know what activities or things are being done around your community because you are part of that community for a reason. If you are in a community and you decide not to help out or engage in any conversations, it can be ignorant of yourself and can create a bad appearance for you in front of others.\n\n\nEngaging with current events can definitely do something, as it can open up your eyes to the different sides of a situation and let you understand what is happening around you. Even though that it might be at a national or international level, you will still be able to understand what is happening so if something related happens to you like it, you will be able to respond. This is also a daily opportunity to learn different perspectives and learn how to react when reading the news. For example, if you read a news article about a conflict between two communities fighting about gun control around the area, you could learn why gun control is so controversial in the United States. You could also learn the two sides of the situation and why each side has its' reasons and why the topic is so controversial. Although it will be very difficult to enforce stricter gun control or take care of the millions of guns on American streets, you will still have valuable knowledge that you will be able to discuss with others and people around you. Even though you are knowing this information will probably not change anything about the topic, that doesn't mean you should stop learning and being aware of events around you.\n\nIn conclusion, although it is not \"being bad citizens\" if we don't keep up with the news, I do think that everyone should have some responsibility to know what is happening around them, mostly at a community level. I only think they should only be required to be aware of news in a community level rather than an international level because even if they have knowledge of events at an international level, they will rarely change the outcome of the event. Even though you won't make a difference at an international level, engaging with current events can also be beneficial as it can open up your eyes to the different sides of a situation, help you understand what is happening around you, developing more knowledge that can be useful to you.

{"essay": "\nWhile \"bad citizen\" might be going a little bit far in describing those who don't keep up with the news, these individuals are almost certainly not going to be effective citizens. A citizen is by definition someone who actively participates in their society and engages with the political, social, and economic issues of the day. It seems almost impossible that someone would be able to perform citizenship without the underlying knowledge required to make political choices, speak up on social isssues, or participate in a national economy. It is probably impossible to keep up with the news in its entirety these days, as there is an overwhelming amount of information coming at us from all directions. However, there is a base line level of media and political literacy required of us if we are to be meaningful agents in the democratic process. Democracy itself relies on the informed choices of individuals; indeed, freedom of speech and of the press are heralded as watershed democratic rights without which there is no democracy, and censorship is one of the starkest indicators of a repressive regime.\n\nFor these reasons, everyone seeking to engage in citizenship simply must be somewhat aware of what is going on in at least their immediate world. In a place like the U.S., a federalist government with a heavy nationalist presence, this includes staying up to date with American as well as state and local politics.    International news and global events is also an important part of understanding the world, especially with the ever-increasing connectivity of our society. However, there are limits on what can be expected of us as citizens. In my opinion, our first responsibility is to stay appraised of core issues relating to human rights, structural political issues, and anything that promises long-lasting effects. Issues such as climate change, healthcare, the pandemic, and gun violence, are existential in nature and therefore require everyone to care at least somewhat about addressing them. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, for example, collective awareness of the virus's symptoms, transmission rates, and healthcare implications were essential for mitigation.  \n\nIn a democratic system, engaging with current events is the whole game, for current events determine which way the political winds are blowing and directly inform the voting choices of the populace. Some cynicism is warranted as to whether watching the news and staying informed actually helps effect change\u2014the rapidly shifting news cycle, after all, can often times make it difficult to stay focused on major issues long enough to affect real, tangible change. However, not attempting to stay apprised of current events would be taking valuable information and power out of the hands of the country's electing constituents and leave our governance in chaos. For these reasons, it is clear that keeping up with the news is essential for anyone looking to engage with their society and be a meaningful citizen, whether this means voting in the presidential election, making intentional consumer choices, or simply speaking up on issues that matter.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, it is our responsibility to know what is happening in the world. Keeping up with the news can help us be more informed citizens and make more thoughtful decisions that have an impact on our lives and the lives of others. It is very difficult not to pay any attention to local and world events, but some people make a conscious effort to be uninformed. This lack of awareness breeds apathy, which can have a negative effect on our communities and the progress of society. By actively engaging with current events and understanding what is happening in the world, we become more informed citizens and more engaged in our communities.\n\nFor example, there are tragic events happening in our country and around the world seemingly nonstop. Being aware of these events means people can help. People can donate their money or time, advocate for change, or simply express sympathy for those affected. When a tragedy such as a hurricane or tornado strikes a community, news coverage of the event means that people all over the world can help the community recover by donating supplies, money, and time. \n\nEven if we do not take direct action, knowledge of current events can lead to meaningful conversations and debates. Many people avoid talking about politics these days because it can lead to disagreements; however, I think healthy political conversation can bring awareness to issues and help people see alternate points of view. This kind of dialogue can often lead to solutions and progress. For example, mass shootings and school shootings have plagued our country during the last twenty years. A conversation about how to best address gun control and mental health issues could lead to solutions that save lives.

When it comes to the news and media literacy, that is a topic that is vastly important as the traditional news media that has long existed in the United States starts to change. With the advent of digital media technologies, it is easier than ever for citizens to become informed about current events.\n\nUnfortunately, it is also easier for people to be misinformed about what is going on. Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are flooded with incorrect information that is often portrayed in a catchy, easy-to-digest format like memes. This misinformation can influence people\u2019s attitudes and opinions about current events without them even realizing it.\n\nWhat this requires is for people to regularly utilize critical thinking. If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. People should also actively seek out factual information from reliable sources and make an effort to keep up with the news. Being able to recognize what sources are reputable and which ones aren't is important. When surfing the web, it is important to check several sites to confirm what is going on and get a full picture of the story.\n\nEngaging with current events can be helpful, depending on your intentions.

However, if you are using it to intimidate, bully or try to deceive the public, it's a bit of a concern. \n\nMy feeling on the issue comes from 15 years working in journalism part or full-time with the print media.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not necessarily make us bad citizens, but it can have some negative impacts on our level of civic engagement and awareness. As citizens, it is only important that we engage our immediate environment. This raises the important question, what does a citizen stand to gain by keeping up with the news? The overarching answer is that the reward might not be material but it sure has its benefits. \n\nThere is a popular saying that \"Information is power.\" Hence, any individual or citizen should prioritize having as much relevant information they need for their daily activities. This will include listening to the latest and trendy activities in their environment. These details help them to be equipped on how to make other important decisions. \n\nKeeping up with the news also helps in molding active civic engagement and activities. For example, if there is an upcoming election or referendum in your local area, being aware of the news will give you the opportunity to partake and become more responsible. As such, you can choose the best candidate you think would be capable and help the growth of your society. Similarly, not being aware via the news can make you miss some important life updates. \n\nThe weather is another perfect example here. It can get extreme and harsh at some times of the year. If you are not aware of the weather news, you may be unable to prepare properly in advance to limit its effects on you, your family or community. Rather than stay back at home, you can set out and end up facing avoidable dangers. \n\nBased on medical research, listening to the news can have a positive impact on the cognitive ability of a sick (but recovering) person. As a result, hospitals and clinics make provisions for a television, radio, or newspaper for their patients to engage the news. You do not have to be sick but this is why we are encouraged to spend more time engaging with news.\n\nThis age is known for how much it values information. Hence, it is known as the information age. Keeping up with the news broadens one\u2019s knowledge and also provides ideological grounding. It makes you have the right knowledge and ideologies about the social, economic, cultural, and religious state of the society. \n\nA major advantage of listening to the news is that it helps us to be a part of history. It is one of the best ways to remember and gain a better understanding about the events that have taken place in the past. Much more, knowing the news provides an opportunity to interact better with people from other cultures and countries.

While screens can have a huge variety of beneficial uses, they also come with some mental and physical health risks that are not commonly talked about among consumers of technology and media. I am of the opinion that we as a society should be mindful of the impact of screen time on our own health, as well as the health of our children as they learn and grow.\n\n\nWe should not ignore the potential detrimental effects of long-term screen time, even considering how much we rely on our devices in just about every aspect of our day-to-day lives. Throughout all of our lives, we should be aware that screens have the potential to cause many different health concerns. These concerns can include (but are certainly not limited to) eyestrain, headaches, neck pain, and even regular sleep deprivation. Prolonged screen exposure on a regular basis can also lead to a variety of mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem (all of which are things that I have personally experienced on a more prominent level since the beginning of the pandemic).\n\nGiven all of these potential consequences from extended screen time, I believe that it is incredibly important for us to be mindful of the amount of time that we spend engaging with technology of any variety. As a way to prevent issues with technology exposure, we should ensure that we are taking regular breaks throughout the day and engaging in activities that help us to stay physically, mentally, and emotionally healthy. It is also important to be aware of the hours in a day that are set aside for rest and sleep in order to maintain proper energy levels throughout the day!\n\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is of the utmost importance to be mindful of the effects of too much screen time.

For example, this has helped a lot of schools with production and efficiency of their assignments and has helped create a much more efficient school environment. \n\nAdditionally, it is important for us to stay connected with our friends and family during this difficult time, and screens are providing us with that opportunity. In times of need and tragedy, we must connect with each other to make sure everything is alright so we can make sure our family members are alright. We could see that this was much needed during the pandemic especially when almost everyone was worried about catching the coronavirus and we really needed emotional support to help get through this. Especially if you have family that is around the world, this was even more needed so we can make sure that they are okay and they are safe or so we can diminish the fear of them being harmed from the coronavirus.\n\nUltimately, screens have become our lifeline. From work to school to socializing, screens are the one thing that has kept us connected and allowed us to adapt to this changing world. We can see new inventions that will excel humans to the next generation with new and exciting technology. So, instead of worrying about screen time during the pandemic, let\u2019s think about the positive aspects and ways to use it safely and responsibly. We can see technology helping us learn online and a way for extra help away from school. Online, you can find many courses and videos that can enhance your knowledge and where you will most definitely find the help that you need with various choices to choose from.\n\nIn conclusion, screens have been a necessary tool during this pandemic and should not be feared as it can provide us with many advantages. We should be more focused on how to use it safely and responsibly so that we can benefit from the advantages of it. People should avoid places where they might not be safe, and we should also focus on creating a safer environment on the internet as a whole. For example, we can help delete all sites that may scam people or where illegal activities are present.  Let us use this opportunity to make the best out of it and use it as a leverage for humanity\u2019s benefit. We can help develop new technology that will help advance our use of the internet and efficiency as a whole. So instead of worrying about it, let us make the best out of it and create something new!

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, we should be more worried about screen time than ever before. For instance, for children and adolescents, too much screen time can cause mental health problems, obesity, sleep disturbances, increased aggressive behavior, and difficulty paying attention. Such occurrences show that the dangers that were posed with increased screen time still exist and there should be more interventions in place to prevent the practice. Besides, it is important to remember that screens are not a substitute for real-life social contact and interpersonal relationships. Therefore, more people will loose the skills required for human interaction whenever there are physical interactions. The increase of screen time means that the future will have more mental issues and people who cannot interact well with each other in the absence of smart devices such as smartphones.\nI believe there are some benefits that exist because of the digital devices. However, there is need for the time spent on the devices to be limited. For instance, parents should set limits on the type of content, amount of screen time and a daily minimum for tech-free activities such as physical exercise. In doing so, children can spend more time acquiring important skills that are needed in a society where people interact physically. There is also the benefit of mitigating the mental illnesses that have been associated with spending to much time in isolation. It is safe to say that everyone must be aware of the risks associated with long-term screen use and should take the necessary steps to reduce the practice.\nThe starting point of ensuring that the screen time is well managed is knowing that the digital devices are part of society. Therefore, the process of reducing the screen time should begin with the developers of the digital devices. For instance, the developers of digital devices should create devices that have filters and settings that limit both the type and time that an individual user can spend on them. Such actions can reduce the burden that parents will have to bear in the battle against screen time with their children. Every stakeholder needs to take initiative in ensuing that the future generations do not become overdependent on digital devices for their interaction and entertainment. \nTherefore, the government also has a role to play in tackling the issue. The government can come up with more stringent laws or regulations that will ensure safety and protection of individuals when it comes to the use of digital devices. Such actions can be grounded on the health concerns that emerge from the use of the digital devices. Through such an approach there can more support from the society in addressing the issue of screen time especially when it comes to children and adolescents who are at more risk than any other age group. \n\nIn conclusion, the pandemic has exposed us to increased screen time and we should be worried about it.", "path": "./logs/pilot/fdb38ee93e104056a3565cfe326870a5.jsonl", "prompt": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, ready and consistent access to computer screens is the greatest thing to ever happen to the human race. Adolescents and developing minds need regular and nonstop access to computer screens for a myriad of reasons, and in this work, I will explore the many advantages of our screen time. While derided as \"excessive\" by Luddites and the otherwise ignorant, computer screens provide an enriching, healthy, and viable alternative to the dreary muck that is our regular lives. Without screen time, we would be lost. Do not lambast parents for planting their children in front of devices that will support them for the rest of their lives. Do not regret Coronavirus and its dramatic impacts on our screen-mediated communication. Celebrate instead the influence the screen has on our lives. Let us explore together as we discuss the many advantages to our present and future lives with screens.\n\nTo begin with, screens promote safety and access to resources. During the pandemic, screens have acted as virtual libraries where students and teachers can access material for school projects, courses, and work-related tasks. On a broader level, screens provide a solution for nurses and doctors to access patient records remotely and without putting their patients or their own health at risk. And for those without access to reliable healthcare, tablets and smartphones can be used to access vital medical information from credible sources.\n\nScreen time also improves efficiency and productivity. For remote workers, knowing how to use the internet, email, and other software applications has allowed them to work and communicate with colleagues in ways they never thought possible. Similarly, businesses of all sizes have had to quickly adapt their operations and invest in technology tools that help them stay connected and productive.\n\nFinally, screens provide an invaluable connection to family and friends. We don\u2019t need to be physically present to communicate with our loved ones. We can easily use video chat and other applications to connect with them. For those living alone, this has been a blessing during these times of isolation.\n\nIn conclusion, screen time does not need to be feared during the pandemic, but rather embraced as an opportunity to become more knowledgeable, productive, and connected to the world. With access to digital devices, we can be better prepared to face any challenges that may come our way and stay connected with those we love.", "path": "./logs/pilot/3d60e2927c6145dfa819c9fe0864a4a4.jsonl", "prompt": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there must be a balance between screen time and human interaction. While the pandemic did cause an increase in screen time, this was a debate long before 2020. In fact, I can recall watching hours of television every day during summer breaks as a child. My brother and I had a daily viewing schedule, and it did not occur to my parents that there was anything wrong with this. We also went outside, rode bikes, and played with friends. Although the devices our children are using have changed, the screen time issue is not a new one. I think the best approach is to use this time as an opportunity to teach our children about balance.\n\nAs a mother of teenagers, I am very aware of how much time my children spend on electronic devices, particularly cell phones. As parents, our role is to provide guidance and help our kids develop healthy habits. When my children were younger, I tried to limit screen time more. I didn't want a device to be a babysitter, but sometimes putting in a movie or letting my kids play electronic games was an enormous break for me. It would have been easy to allow them more screen time and give myself more \"time off\", but that is where parenting comes in. As with anything, it is important to consider the context. If kids are spending hours every day watching YouTube, playing video games, or mindlessly scrolling through social media, then yes, that can be cause for concern. If they are also spending time connecting with friends and family, completing school assignments, or researching a topic of interest, then the balance may be much healthier. \n\nIt is also important to realize that time spent playing online games with friends might also be beneficial. Gone are the days when children are free to roam the neighborhood, only coming home when the streetlights come on. Even before the pandemic, parents had to worry about the dangers of the outside world. New technologies allow us to stay connected while social distancing. Ultimately, it is up to us as parents to monitor our kids\u2019 screen time, make sure it is balanced between entertainment and school, and find moments for connecting in real life. \n", "path": "./logs/pilot/ec7e488445664c3eb807f327671b4640.jsonl", "prompt": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I believe that with increased screen time becoming the new norm, we should be worried about our well-being. I believe that it is important to understand the potential risks associated with excessive screen time, but also consider the benefits of it.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, digital devices offer significant benefits, which explains why the number of people using digital devices for work and school has increased. However, excessive screen use remains a big issue because it can negatively affect the eyes and cause fatigue. Just as a recent comScore survey found that overall tablet usage went up, it is evident that the demand for digital devices is on the rise because of the benefits of digital devices in the areas of social networking and quick access to vital information. Digital device users should, however, understand that excessive screen time can affect mental health, eyesight, and sleep irregularities. \n\nIn my view, balance is the keyword when it comes to screen time, especially now that it is more difficult to abandon digital devices. I would imagine it is rare to find a family without at least one television, plus smartphones. While excessive screen use and its impacts are a big concern for digital device users, moderation is the best way to prevent any negative effects on their health. To achieve balance, users can set adequate time limits to ensure that their screen time is within a healthy range. In this case, one will get to enjoy the myriad benefits digital devices offer modern users while protecting oneself from the negative impacts of excessive screen time. \n\nDigital devices have become an inseparable part of our culture with the presence of different types of popular brands, so it is essential that we find ways to properly embrace the benefits that they have to offer. To achieve this, users need to ensure a balanced screen time by diverting their attention away from their devices at intervals to prevent excessive screen time. While digital devices are addictive because of the opportunity they offer by allowing users to socialize and access educational and informational resources easily, having a continuous excessive screen time pattern can hamper these benefits because it causes mild health challenges such as chronic neck problems, anxiety, high dependency, and sleep problems, among many others. So, it is important to ensure a balanced screen time. \n\nHowever, I think it is high time we abandoned our fears and doubts about digital devices and leveraged their benefits at work and in school. I believe that excessive screen time can be controlled by individual users so that their health is not at risk and that they also get to use digital devices to their highest advantage. Excessive screen time does not necessarily mean danger because it has benefits such as increased wellbeing, socialization, creativity, and high psychosocial effects. So I believe that it is safe to get over the fear of the dangers of excessive screen time to embrace the benefits of digital devices.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there is definitely cause for concern, particularly when it comes to how much young children and adolescents are using screens right now. The worry is about how distracting this can be for them from important activities they should be engaged in. For children, it could distract them from their studies and make them become lackadaisical. This is not any encouraging news for any parent. \n\nFor adults, increased screen time has same effect. It can distract us from making meaningful relationships, engaging in physical activities such as exercise, and the development of other useful skills. Often times, people do not know the far-reaching implication until the deed is done and there is no remedy.  The challenge with excess screen time is that you will not know you have not been faithful with the exercises or focus on self-development. \n\nHowever, that being said, there are some potential benefits of increased screen time right now. Having the ability to connect with friends and family through screens can be incredibly beneficial for maintaining mental health during these trying times. Sometimes, we all need one person to check on us and give us a reason to not quit. Hence, elongated screen time can mean a lot to someone else and saving their lives. \n\nThe other numerous benefits of screen time include easier access to learning resources, affording people with on-demand entertainment, creating virtual meeting spaces for distant collaboration and simply just being able to stay connected. In this age, you have a ton of resources within your fingertip and you can learn anything. I have a friend who speaks seven languages fluently. They include English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and a little bit of South Korean. \n\nI used to think he had parents from these countries and he had no choice but to learn. However, that was not the case as he learnt all these languages except English and Spanish from online resources. I have even made a joke of him of spending too much time on his iPad. Whereas, he was learning these languages and today, he can speak seven already.  \n\nYou may want to control how children use screen time because of several reasons. They can abuse it by spending a lot of time and suffer health consequences. However, limiting the use of screens for adults may be more difficult particularly with the importance of digital accessibility and remote working. It is the reality of our current world and it is only logical that we adjust to it. \n\n\nIn conclusion, although there is reason to be worried about the risks of excessive screen time during the pandemic, there are also potential benefits that can help us move forward.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, audiobooks can help a person read when they lack enough time to do so with a traditional or digital book. Audiobooks have the advantage of being able to be enjoyed at any convenient time throughout the day, whether it\u2019s on a bus or in one's car on a drive home. On the other hand, visual reading requires a person to exclusively use their vision to read. Additionally, audiobooks expand the outreach to people with visual impairments or disabilities. Overall, I personally believe that there are both advantages and disadvantages to each method of reading.\n\nIn today's society, people don't have as much \"quiet time\" as they did before. This is due to having so many different activities constantly competing for one's attention. Those conflicting variables may be related to family responsibilities, work, or simply a lack of time to devote exclusively to reading. Most of the things in our environment require visual focus. Therefore, if a person can multitask, they can listen to a book while driving home from work, watching their kids play at a park, or even during work, if permitting. This makes it more attractive to those who find it hard to make the time for reading. \n\nSome may say that audiobooks and multitasking is not as an in-depth experience as traditional reading. This isn't so. A person may be able to close their eyes to full visualize the material that they are reading. Like meditation, for example, visual stimuli can be distracting, and eliminating it can improve focus. Additionally, audiobooks have narrators that make the story come alive. The influence of the narrator's acting skills may assist a person in immersing themselves in the story. \n\nThat being said, certain types of books may be better suited for traditional or visual reading. A book whose language perhaps deals with technical information requiring visual media such as graphs, charts, flow diagrams, etc. can't be communicated via audio. Furthermore, when one reads visual texts, they can scan and focus on portions of long texts to quickly navigate to the information they need. It\u2019s also easier for them to search the text for particular words, phrases or quotes. So, for activities that require research or direct interaction with the material, it would be better to use traditional books. \n\nIn conclusion, whether audio or traditional books are better depends upon the specific desire and situation of the reader. It would be best to combine those, if maximizing the amount of reading that a person can achieve. It\u2019s important to consider if the activity is for relaxing, or if more intensive focus is required.", "path": "./logs/pilot/b9d122c0ddfa42adb136743e0e037791.jsonl", "prompt": "Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?\n\nDo you listen to audiobooks?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, audiobooks offer several advantages over reading a book. Instead of sitting down to read, why not take the opportunity to listen while you\u2019re doing something else? For instance, one of my favorite esoteric pastimes is watching a movie while simultaneously listening to a corresponding audiobook; the combination of visuals and audio narrations makes for a unique, immersive experience. Why, just last week I was watching a Bresson. It was one of my favorites: \u201cAu hasard Balthazar\u201d (1966). The audiobook I chose to pair with my favorite donkey-centered opus was \u201cThe Divine Comedy,\u201d and it coincided in uncanny harmony. Now granted, my translation of Dante's trip down memory lane is not orthodox - I prefer the rhyming stanzas of Robert Pinsky - but it\u2019s still a damn cool way to spend my Sunday. The audiobook of Pinsky's vulgar rhymes with the delightful downfall of Balthazar was a mental flavor sensation that simply could not be gained, in full, by either medium alone.\n\nNow some will say audiobooks are not as good as simply reading a book (and I won\u2019t necessarily argue against that), but it depends on the listener. I will share another anecdote. William S. Burroughs' \"Naked Lunch\" has served as a familiar friend for me for many years, and while its pages have been dog-eared and discolored by my caffeine habits, I recently opted for a new audiobook version. Boy howdy, let me tell you... that audiobook - read by none other than Iggy Pop himself - was a truly mesmerizing experience. Not to mention the fact that Iggy\u2019s gender-bending rasp was incredibly well-suited for Burroughs' unhinged hallucinations. I chose to take this audiobook on solo - no visuals to accompany it - and with no distractions I was able to understand Burroughs\u2019 manic literary genius in a way that I had never done before with the written medium.\n\n\nAll in all, my answer to the posed question is yes - listening to a book can be just as good as reading it. It really depends on the individual and its ability to \u201chear\u201d what a book is saying instead of just seeing it. It's much like jazz - it's the spaces between the notes that allow it to breathe, and stylistic nuances often find themselves lost in translation.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology has had a huge impact on the way dating and relationships operate. Dating apps, especially, have made it easier than ever to meet people, although the type of interaction on them can be quite superficial and make it harder. While many have met using dating apps, there is a \"flattening\" that has happened to the ritualistic process of courtship with apps such as Tinder. This flattening of culture and interactions in the dating process has impacted the emotional aspect of relationships, as well as how people are able to form meaningful connection in a digitalized world. \n\nCountless relationships have been fostered through dating apps and websites. Whereas people would often meet at events of shared interest or in communal spaces like bars or gyms, today many people want a more tailor-made process for finding someone that matches their interests, beliefs, and values. Dating apps provide just this experience. Filters on such apps include the ability to sort potential matches by physical appearance, philosophy, politics, or religion, smoking and drinking and recreational drug habits, and countless other qualities in potential partners. This specificity in partner-selection has made it so that individuals must demonstrate - however superficially - the best image of themselves on a dating app. This has changed the basic \"economy\" of dating and ensured that utilizing a dating app is practically essential in meeting new people.\n\nAt the same time, however, technology has made it much easier to maintain a relationship as well. Texting, FaceTime/Skype, and other forms of online communication have made it so much easier to stay connected even when physical proximity is not an option. When a gulf of many hundreds of miles separate them, couples can still maintain closeness through digital means. Though this closeness is mediated by the limitations of technology, it is still connection. Connection as such is difficult enough to attain through conventional or \"old-fashioned\" means, and technology can provide a crucial supplement in such cases.\n\nOverall, technology has both helped and hindered the dating process. Due to the flattening of the courtship process caused by technology, relationships must now be navigated differently. Yet, it has also allowed us to connect with each other in ways that were not possible before, bringing people together from across the world.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology can have both positive and negative impacts on dating and relationships. Just like anything in life can be, the same principle applies to technology. However,  you must be able to use it to your advantage and not otherwise. \n\nOn the one hand, technology can enable us to find dates more quickly and conveniently than ever before.  I have used several dating sites before and trust me, it just feels like another world entirely. I can give you a brief review of what to expect when using these platforms to find a love life or even sexual flings.  Trust me, it is advisable to be a paid user as most of these sites have all features available to premium users. \n\nThanks to technology, you can meet a potential suitor that lives down your street on these platforms.   You also have the ability to be incredibly picky and filter your matches through categories like age, interests, gender and much more. It does not matter if it is a blind date - you can have video call interactions with them to be sure they are real humans and not bots. Also, with technology, I could connect with new people in every new place I am in. \n\nTechnology has definitely improved the dating lifestyle for those in long distance relationships. Rather than wait to receive a letter from their \"love\" only when the postman delivers, they can contact their partner easily within their fingertip.   Text messages, video calls, video messages are all possible approaches to stay up to date with their daily activities. In the same vein, they can share gifts with each other - even dating sites allow users to share virtual gifts. \n\n\nOn the other hand, technology does have some drawbacks. On dating app, the superficiality of swiping can lead to a focus on physical attractiveness rather than emotional connection. It made me prioritize alternative relationships instead of seeking an actual love life. Who does not like a partner with a banding body? \n\nAlso, technology makes couples miss out on the traditional face-to-face dates. There is often less or no effort to see physically since both parties can always connect via their phones or social media app. Instead of going to the cinema together and experiencing the world, there is a new \"Netflix n Chill\" that makes them stay indoors, even at their respective homes and not in the same space. Everyone would agree that it is just a matter of time as love includes both physical and emotional interaction.\n\nMy advice to young lovers is simple. You can use technology to your advantage. It has connected us all more than ever before, but it also made us more disconnected than we\u2019ve ever been in the past. Pay attention to your partner's needs and do not let the use of technology distract you from reality. \n\nSome people are pretenders - I met a lot of them while using those dating apps. They claim to be loving until you meet them in person. So, get to connect with people physically to know their interests and disinterest. Technology does not have to mar your dating life if you make good choices.\n\nLong story short, I believe technology can improve dating and relationships when used in constructive ways.", "path": "./logs/pilot/3f5c605c2f304bb2b792e26877902ed7.jsonl", "prompt": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology can improve and worsen romantic interactions depending on how it is used. I can certainly concede that with the emergence of the internet, the world has gotten a lot smaller. It\u2019s now easier than ever to meet people through online dating apps, dating sites, and even social media. This, I would say, fundamentally is or can be a good thing. However, take social media, for instance, which is teeming with beautiful people showing the best parts of their lives, projecting confidence and success. I suspect the reality is much more dismal. But this projection, made possible by the internet, causes a misconception that leads people to think that there might be something wrong with them if they do not measure up to the perceived status quo. It can also lead to a lack of or deficiencies in real-time connection, communication, and true emotional intimacy. \n\nTechnology has birthed many ways to entertain us, no doubt about it. Apps like Netflix and Hulu have made it easier than ever to watch shows, movies, etc., but this also serves as a potential hindrance to a healthy perception of what real relationships are supposed to look like. As a result, one might have unrealistic expectations for the person sitting across the table from them on their first date, thanks to Tinder or whatever the dating app flavor of the day is. Similarly, a person might have unrealistic expectations about how they should look or act as well. Later in a relationship, this can rear its ugly head again when people are dissatisfied with their relationships because of what TV, movies, shows, etc., have done unknowingly to their ideas of what intimacy should look like. It is no wonder divorce rates are so high.\n\nRegarding dating app platforms, with the advent of the internet, it was inevitable. I have never used one of these platforms, having already met my wife before the Internet, so I am not an authority by any means. But, I would say that as \"cringy\" as I might feel about them, they are not necessarily a bad thing or concept. I am sure some platforms are seedier than others, but I have known folks to meet their spouse or significant other on these platforms and have had a great and lasting relationship. So, in that regard, I would say, awesome! The intent is met, and everyone is happy. Right? Probably not.

{"essay": "\nI have never been much of a dater--I met my current long-term girlfriend in college and she was the only one I ever really dated, so I largely missed the current trend of dating apps and other technology-assisted dating setups. If I ever re-entered the dating world, I think I would probably end up using them just because I am almost always in favor of technology, but I am certain that doing so would give me great anxiety. Dating itself is already anxiety-inducing in my opinion, so the idea of having to meet up on what essentially amount to blind dates sounds like a nightmare to me. To be sure, meeting someone organically can be anxiety-inducing as well, but at least that's, well, organic, and the excitement of the moment is enough to overcome those negative feelings for the most part.\n\nI think time will tell just how technology affects dating and relationships, but it's perfectly obvious that it has certainly had an effect. On the one hand, it can make finding a date much more efficient than it was before\u2014you no longer have to walk up to someone in the street or at some other location in the wild. You're presented with a buffet of different people that you can simply choose to accept or reject. I do wonder if this has resulted in dating becoming considerably more superficial than it used to be, however. Since people are deciding whether they're interested or not based solely on a largely-generic profile description and a couple of well-curated photos, I have to imagine that many people have missed possible connections that could result in something great. Sometimes, physical attraction comes later in a relationship, and by relying exclusively on dating apps, those possibilities are largely nonexistent. \n\nThe same is true of social media.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology is both extremely helpful and harmful to dating. Dating apps are now commonly referred to as \"hook-up apps\" because most of the time, people on there don't want to date, they want to have no-strings-attached sex. Sex in and out itself is not a bad thing, but if you consider the culture we've built, it's easy to get emotionally hurt when people are using these apps for the sole purpose of sex. \n\nI have had experience on these apps and seldom did I find someone wanting to talk to me and not wanting to hook-up right away. Technology separates our humanity with a screen. While it's easy to meet new people, we don't know anything about them, what they truly act like, look like, or behave. Personalities can be changed with a few taps and clicks before you're talking to a completely different person - and you would never know! \n\nOn the flip side, technology has made it easier to maintain long-distance relationships. For those who are leaving their high-school sweethearts to go to college, or being deployed, or are simply working thousands of miles away - technology keeps us connected. We can FaceTime, Zoom, text, and message each other to strengthen those bonds.\n\nOverall, I think technology affects dating in a way that blurs the lines and creates a more complex landscape. In my personal experience, technology is what lead me to connecting and forming a relationship with my now husband. We used several forms of messaging apps and video chatted for months because we decided to meet in person. The only difference to common online dating stories is that I previously knew him as a friend-of-a-friend. I knew about my husband before our relationship.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are many important things students should learn in school. First and foremost, students should learn about themselves and their own capabilities. I think that students should be taught that they have the ability to try and accomplish anything they set as a goal. They also need to be taught that they will fail at times, and that failure is a valuable tool. Failure teaches us to reevaluate the problem and to try again. \n\n\nSecond, students should learn critical thinking skills. Most people make choices based on emotion. Sometimes, that works. But life is full of problems that need to be evaluated and a solution found after all the parts and angles are looked at. When I was a kid and I or my siblings had a problem with our bikes, the swing set, or anything else, we would go ask our dad to fix it. He would frequently tell us \"Go study the problem.\" He wanted us to learn to see all the moving parts, evaluate the problem and what was causing it, and then figure out how to fix it and what would be needed to fix it. If we needed help along the way, he was happy to take a look and make suggestions. This habit of his, which greatly annoyed us, turned out to be one of the greatest lessons our dad taught us. It has opened many doors and made each of us much better at our chosen professions. \n\n\nFinally, students should learn to be kind, empathetic, and understanding. This may be the most important thing for a child to learn. It does not matter how successful you are, how much money you earn, what kind of car you drive, or where you go to college. What truly matters in this life is how you live, and how you treat others. Especially, how you treat children, the elderly, and those who are less fortunate than yourself. Even when it feels like your life is a complete mess, it doesn't take long to look around and see that there are many people who have it worse than you do. The best cure for personal sadness is to look around and find a way to help someone else. This is the true meaning of success.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, reading, writing, math, and the sciences are all very important. Arguably reading is the most important since without being able to read, learning or developing the ability to teach oneself is much more limited. However, that all said, I think even more important is to learn how to think critically and to be able to analyze information to make informed decisions. This is important because the ability to think critically can be applied to every part of life and will help one make more educated choices, especially in the realm of decision-making. One of my favorite scientists growing up and still to this day was Carl Sagan. To paraphrase Sagan on the topic of critical thinking and how vital to hone our built-in baloney detection kit, said another way, our ability to think critically. Simply put, critical thinking can help aid in the deciphering of truth from fiction to unraveling knotty problems, which require taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture with scrutiny relying on evidence-based conclusions over feelings or beliefs.\n\nIn my own life, I feel that one of the most important things I have learned in school is how to think critically, which has helped me significantly in my life. And for that, I have both my freshman-year science teacher, Mr. Syer, and of course, Dr. Carl Sagan. I thank the former for introducing me to the latter through watching the Cosmos series in school when the rolling television and VCR combo was still a thing in schools. Mr. Syer allowed us to watch many of the episodes as a part of our science curriculum, which sparked my lifelong love for science and critical thinking. My ability to think critically has not only helped me in school in the form of higher grades, but it has also been instrumental in helping me to make important life decisions that I like to think were based on reasoning and logic and less given to being impulsive flights of fancy fueled by emotions.\n\nI believe that critical thinking is a tool that we have in our toolbox that has to be continuously sharpened by allowing oneself to be humble enough to observe and to be patient before casting decisions based on confirmation bias, pride, and hubris. I would consider critical thinking to be the cornerstone of scientific pursuit and, if observed, will aid me and other students in the future, no matter what profession they choose or whatever challenges life throws at them. I liken the skill of critical thinking to the parable of fishing. Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the most important things that students should learn in school are the ones that allow them to function in the real world. Such things include interpersonal skills, financial literacy and science. Interpersonal skills are important because they help build successful relationships with peers, colleagues and the people in our lives. Therefore, there is more cohesion and peace in the society compared to a situation where one is prematurely integrated in society lacking the skills to interact and understand the other person. On the other hand, financial literacy is crucial because it helps individuals make wise financial decisions especially in this age of technology where consumers are bombarded with many options. Lastly, science is an important component because it creates innovative minds that find solutions for challenges facing the society such as disease, climate change and hunger.\nThe most important thing that I have learned in school was never taught, but was acquired through interaction with my fellow students and educators. Hence, the most important thing I have learned is socializing. Being able to socialize with other people is important because it encourages me to be more open minded, create meaningful relationships and also learn from others. Besides, in a work environment one needs other people to form teams with common goals so that the projects can be completed effectively. Everywhere in society for anything to be achieved there is need for teams or groups of people working towards the same goal. Being in school has allowed me to understand how people manipulate each other and how to create environments where people can share their opinions and still come to an agreement.\nSuch knowledge has also been important in the way I interact with my family members. For example, in society there are bullies who try to take advantage of other people and make them feel inferior. Through my experience with such bullies in school I have come to understand that they are ordinary people who struggle with their emotions and this has enabled me to empathize with them and help find a resolution instead of fighting. Through my enhanced social skills interacting with people with different temperaments I have come to appreciate that people are diverse. Diversity is part of society that needs to be embraced.\nAs mentioned earlier, I believe my social skills are important for my future because they allow me to integrate in society effectively. In addition, I can equate my social skills with cultural awareness, which is important in any industry. Cultural awareness and social skills give me the opportunity to find commonalities with people from different backgrounds that would have otherwise been impossible if I was not open minded. Therefore, I have the ability to enhance cohesion in the places I work or the people I meet and interact with", "path": "./logs/pilot/637ead38a9094f85b35b4e7a6800fa98.jsonl", "prompt": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, Students should learn the bare basics to allow them to understand a grasp other concepts and build upon them if they so choose to go deeper into that certain subject. As for after they finish the bare minimum of things they are required to learn, I believe that students should be taught life skills and core values such as problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, teamwork, and leadership that will help them become successful in everyday life. But furthermore, I think they should get the choice after that of what they want to focus on, whether that is a certain area of study or general knowledge, as long as they get the choice of what they want to study before they go to college.\n\nWhen we are talking about the most important thing or things, that is too wide of a question because it really is up to the student what the most thing or things to learn are. For example, different regions have different focuses regarding the education system, which mean that there cant be one or more important things for students to learn in schools. For example, in the USA, if a student wanted to follow a career path towards being a computer science/computer analyst, then they would want to explore more in the area of math, computer information systems, and programming languages. The majority of schools don't offer any sort of major or way to follow one specific path into a career that they choose until students are in college. \n\nWhat is the most important thing I have learned in school? Personally, it is a little hard to answer that question because of what things can be applied to and why we learn things. I believe that the US education system had good intentions when it was designed. To give students the basics and allow them to pursue a major of their choosing at a later grade level, but the flaws of the system increased the likely hood of students rebelling and not wanting to focus on one narrowed-down career path later because of their unwanting to learn the basics. Important subjects can look like many different things, such as the core classes (Math, English, and Science), but furthermore, it is important in this day and age to know how to use a computer, to know how to troubleshoot in any situation, and how to write something that lets other understand your thoughts.\n\nThe reason we go from the core classes to picking what type of major we want to invest our time in is that since there are so many different types of jobs, no one career path will also allow you to do someones else's job just as well as you did your previous job. The most important thing I learned while in school has been to do things myself and to be able to troubleshoot things on my own and go down a general list that is similar to my issue and rule out all the things that are causing my problem. I did not learn that from school, but while I was in school because I taught myself how to solve an issue because my major in computer science required it to be successful. This knowledge has given me the ability to continue to learn because I learned that getting stuck doesn't mean I have to stop it just means I have to find another way around. This knowledge helped me with getting from high school to college, even though it was not a common path that my high school had for its students to have majors, as it was not natural to have CTE classes that students were in every day. I am unsure about my success in the future because I don't know what I will end up doing; the only way I can ensure I have a well-off future is to work hard and instill the lessons that are necessary to be able to improve my work ethic and knowledge.", "path": "./logs/pilot/9d5d3a3859d445b8bfe7d6bd1e3b6328.jsonl", "prompt": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school?

{"essay": "When I began my teaching career, I had idealistic views about what students needed to know. I teach composition and literature, and I frequently have students ask, \"When are we ever going to use this in real life?\" It pressured me to come up with a real practical answer. My idealistic answer is that everyone needs to know at least the basic literary canon. But then, as I taught in a rural Texas school, I truly considered the students' question: Do they need to know Beowulf? Hamlet? Frankenstein? Then I expanded this question to other courses: Algebra 2? four science credits? So, I asked my students what they felt they needed out of high school, and I found their answers to be insightful. Based on their answers and my experience, there are five key areas of knowledge that students need for success: communication skills, critical thinking skills,  technical literacy, and life skills.\n\nTeaching literature and composition hones critical thinking and communication skills. Critical thinking encourages students to examine and evaluate their resources, and communication skills give them the power to express themselves clearly. In their careers, they probably don't need to know that Beowulf killed three monsters, but they do need the ability to read a complex text and tease out the understanding. As adults, they will need to read tax documents, leases, insurance papers, contracts, and other essential paperwork. The critical thinking and reading comprehension they learned in literature class will help them read these complex documents. The writing skills learned in English class will allow them to communicate clearly and efficiently in their workplace. For example, in an oil refinery, operators need to communicate the conditions of the unit at shift change to the new workers. effective communication could mean the difference between safe and efficient functioning and an explosion.\n\nAs our society moves more and more to online resources, we need to ensure our kids are able to adapt to new technologies. Technical literacy gives students the tools to use technology confidently and safely, which can lead to many career options. In fact, some statisticians predict that the careers our children will pursue haven't even been invented yet. Another area we should be teaching in school is \"adulting.\" Life skills such as budgeting, banking, cooking, clothes shopping, and car maintenance will prove to be invaluable when they move into young adulthood. Many of my students complain that school hasn't taught them how to pay their taxes, plan a menu and a grocery list, and even sew on a button and mend clothes.

Since the school is composed of kids and adults from different backgrounds and experiences, it is the perfect setting to teach students the importance of teamwork and good communication skills. So, learning in school goes beyond learning math and English, students must also learn the importance of teamwork, budgeting, organisation, creative thinking, among many others. \n\nThe most important thing I learned in school was the ability to efficiently organise my time to ensure that I do my class assignments properly and still have time for other extracurricular activities.

{"essay": "I have extensive experience with mindfulness and meditation as well as the spiritual philosophical underpinnings and history of these practices. The practice of meditating in the traditional sense of quieting the body and mind has always been a challenge for me as I lack the focus and discipline at present to really commit. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is a free and easy practice that I use daily to check in with the present moment and become aware. Teaching mindfulness and meditation in school is an excellent idea, and I don't really see any downsides. However, there are many many ways one could go about teaching these practices and some will be more appropriate for schools than others.\n\nBasic mindfulness and meditation have been proven to confer a multitude of physical and mental health benefits. It can help increase concentration and focus; reduce stress and anxiety; foster awareness of self and others; improve emotional regulation and more. Children are under an inestimable amount of emotional, mental, and psychological pressure, and giving them space to just be could transform their lives. In addition, group meditative practice in schools has the potential to foster a strong sense of community between students and encourage empathy, peacefulness, and calm. All of these could have a positive effect on classroom dynamics and create a safe, supportive environment for everyone. Mindfulness practices taught in schools could be reinforced through free student subscriptions to various mindfulness and meditation apps on the market, which students could use at home before bed or first thing in the morning to regulate themselves.   Schools teaching mindfulness could also have mental health counselors, teachers, or other professionals on staff to lead meditations during the day and hold regular check-ins.\n\nThere are no conceivable drawbacks of teaching mindfulness and meditation in schools other than the various time and money costs the school itself would have to bear. Curricula are already rigorously chosen and honed for optimal educational benefits, so the decision to teach meditation would require hard conversations around whether meditation would be worth adding to school schedules.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I have tried meditation once or twice. I closed my eyes listened to the ocean and just felt like I was outside of my body. I felt at eased and relaxed during the process.  \n\nI do think that mindfulness and meditation should have a place in schools. It would be amazing if this was an elective in school. I say elective because not everyone will take it seriously when it's time to meditate. I wouldn't say this should be a mandatory class for that reason.  It will help a lot of stressed/tensed students. Just imagine how much stress high school and college students go through on the daily! This would definitely be a game changer! This would be very beneficial for school. Mindfulness and meditation can really help students get into a mindset of being mindful, being aware of their own feelings, not only that but it also teaches them how to take care of their mental health. So, this would be a very valuable class if it was in the school's curriculum. \n \nIn conclusion, I think that Schools should really consider teaching mindfulness and meditation as an elective class because of its many benefits such as helping students become more mindful, aware of their own feelings, and learn how to take care of their mental health.  I wish my school had this; it would have taught me to meditate when I was stress in my adulthood. This class would be a great learning opportunity for students.\n\nResponse 2: \nIn my opinion I don't think meditation is beneficial to have in school or for me. Meditation is something that should be done in your personal time and not when you are in class or around other people. This is something that schools shouldn't focus on but more of a personal matter. Meditation is a practice to help clear your mind, but I think that it can be problematic when done in class and too distracting. I believe this can be very distracting especially to the kids who don't take it seriously and will take it as free time. \n\nInstead of having it in schools, I believe that schools should focus more on teaching students how to manage their emotions, stress and anxiety. Now this will be very beneficial in so many ways. Imagine a student who has bad anxiety and always having outburst in class. Instead of kicking that student out of class, maybe focus on about 10-15 minutes on how to deal with emotions, stress and anxiety. This could go a long way. \n\nIn conclusion, I think instead of having meditation in schools, schools should focus on teaching students how to manage emotions, stress and anxiety. This could be very beneficial for the students who struggle with their emotions and need help on how to balance different aspects of life. This could also help students in the long run on how to manage emotions, stress and anxiety and a key factor to living a healthy life.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, cultivating self awareness through meditation or contemplative practices is essential for individual development and socialization. Mindfulness and meditation can help children to become better attuned to their bodies, feelings, and thoughts.

It may seem contradictory, but a person practicing self awareness practices imagining what others think and feel. This is a practice of empathy per se. This means that by being mindful, people can become more aware of how they impact their environment and the people they interact with. This leads the person to being to question: \"How do I want to be perceived?\" To answer this, the person beings to make actions purposefully to achieve the desired interpretation. ASsuming that they want people to perceive them as good, they would act in a way that achieves harmony. \n\nThis mindfulness practice, when taught from an early age in schools, can foster positive behavior and socialization skills. Thus, including it in schools would be essential for building a moral character within students. This moral character will translate to strengthening the moral fabric of society. Mindfulness and meditation practices can allow people to become more aware of themselves and those around them, and thus foster better understanding between people.

Mindfulness and meditation can help develop better self-awareness, stress reduction and emotional regulation, which are both beneficial in a classroom setting. But I think it is important to consider the audience and potential cultural implications of teaching such practices in a school setting first.\n\nI am a teacher but also someone who has a lot of trouble staying still. When trying mindfulness and meditation for the first time, I found it incredibly challenging to sit still, stay in the present moment and focus on my thoughts. I found it a lot easier when I was given the opportunity to move around, practice breathing exercises and find a comfortable position that worked for me. My problem was not being aware of my thoughts or feelings. Finally what worked was to practice while running. It helped to bring my focus on the present moment while running and this has become my preferred way to practice mindfulness.\n\nMy reason for bringing this up is to mainly discuss how sometimes it is best to adjust the practice for the individual. So when deciding whether or not to introduce this at school, it is important to consider how mindfulness and meditation can be personalized for everyone so that they are more likely to engage with them. I'm not sure how this would work in large classes. Some students come from poor backgrounds, others might be from middle class or affluent families. It would be hard to fit a curriculum to all the students.\n\nIf schools could find ways to introduce mindfulness into a variety of practices, including art, physical education and maybe even the classroom, that could be a great way for students to learn their own personalised forms of mindfulness. It could be helpful to learn the practice early on so that they have the tools to remain in control of their emotions and their physical health.

{"essay": "\nI believe it is not selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Sports might mean something different to each person. But sports allow humans to push themselves to their physical limits and compete for victory. Even in solo sports like mountain climbing, we compete for something, whether personal best or the summit. Pursuing risky sports presents a way to challenge ourselves, build our confidence, and grow.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I do not believe that it is selfish to pursue risky sports. It is up to an individual to live their life the way they want to and do the things they enjoy doing. Rather, I believe it is selfish to expect someone to not pursue risky sports, if they enjoy doing so, just because you may not agree with it. With any physical activity comes the risk of injury, some just prefer to participate in activities that have a higher chance of those injuries. Do I think that calls for labeling them as selfish? No. Ultimately, people should be free to make their own decisions, as long as they can accept the risks and are aware of the potential consequences.\n\nBy definition, a sport is \"an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\" That being said, there is nothing said about danger that disqualifies a sport from being a sport. The amount of risk involved should not be weighed against other factors such as skill and enjoyment to determine whether or not it can be called a sport. Also referring back to the actual definition of what a sport is; \"an activity involving physical exertion\" does not exclude activities that require extreme and almost dangerous amounts of physical exertion. Sports that allow for greater risks to injury or even death are called \"extreme sports\" for that very reason and it is ultimately a choice for one to participate in said sports. Therefore, I do not believe it is selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing.\n\nDrawing the line where one may find a sport and the risks that come with it reasonable or not, is at the discretion of whoever is participating in that sport. It's safe to assume that those who participate in those extreme sports know where they draw the line because that line is up to the individual, not a group of people with an opinion on an activity that they don't participate in themselves. To label these people as selfish for pursuing dangerous pursuits, is unfair and inaccurate. Just because you do not agree with the choices that someone makes on an activity they enjoy doing and does not directly affect or harm others, does not make someone selfish.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not agree that participating in some sports over others, that some may consider extreme or dangerous, is grounds for being called selfish. There are a number of things that someone can participate in that can be considered risky or even dangerous, but that doesn't make someone selfish just because they choose to put themselves in those situations. It is the right of an individual to choose their own activities and take responsibility for the risks associated with them. Everyone should respect that and ultimately, if you are passing judgment on someone else and labeling them as selfish for their personal choice, you are in fact the selfish one.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, everyone is free to make their own decisions as long as they are not hurting others. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to assess the risk of a sport or activity and decide if it is something they should pursue. It is not necessarily selfish for someone to pursue a risky sport like extreme mountain climbing; as long as the individual has taken the necessary precautions to reduce potential risks, death, and injury. It is ultimately their responsibility to weigh the potential risks versus rewards of engaging in such a sport. That being said, they should also weigh this impact on how it will affect family and friends if something did happen. Although that does not mean it is selfish. In the end, it is up to each individual's own discretion.\n\nI don't think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport, and this is why we refer to these high-risk activities as \"extreme sports\". People are allowed to take calculated risks if they want to, as long as they do it safely and responsibly. We take risks like this every day in our lives and many injuries and death are caused by everyday activities such as driving a car, working construction, or crossing the street. Taking risks is part of life, but it's important to weigh the potential consequences of a situation before making a decision. Of course, it is important to minimize risks and make these sports as safe as possible. \n\nAs technology gets better and more accessible, extreme sports are only becoming safer. For example, mountain climbing is used with top-quality equipment that must pass rigorous testing and safety standards. Proper training is also recommended when engaging in any extreme sport. People should also take into consideration any medical conditions that they may have which could increase the risk of engaging in such activities. \n\nEvery sport comes with its own set of risks. Soccer players break bones every day on the field, while many basketball players have lifelong knee problems. Football is one of the most dangerous sports to exist as the research shows the levels of players with concussions and traumatic brain injuries are extremely common. Life is a balance of risk-taking and one should not limit themselves due to the fear of death. Of course, one should not be stupid or impulsive either.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, it is in no way selfish to pursue risky sports. In today's world, simply going outside can be considered a risk considering the rate of car accidents, shootings, and other potential dangers. It feels unethical to classify some extreme sports as not sports anymore simply because there is an elevated level of risk.\n\nIt is also unclear how pursuing an extreme sport can be considered selfish. It does not have an effect on others unless you consider the stress an injury or death to yourself would have on other people. But even at that point, it would feel selfish of those other people to say someone should not pursue an activity they love because they are worried about how they would feel should an injury occur.\n\nAs mentioned in the prompt, all sports bring an element of risk. Countless concussions and head injuries have occurred in football, the soccer player Neymar broke his back while playing as well as several other soccer players who have broken their legs while playing, many basketball players tear their ACLs during practice or games, and more. So, with that in mind, it feels strange to suddenly draw a line and say one sport is too dangerous and therefore should no longer be considered a sport.  At the end of the day, it's up to individuals to make their own decisions about which activities they wish to participate in.\n\nI don't think a line should be drawn as to what can count as a sport and what does not simply because of the risk involved. Instead, individuals should be free to make their own decisions about which activities they pursue and which ones they decide to stay away from. They should also take the necessary precautions to ensure their safety and consider how their pursuits could affect others. Athletes in these extreme sports could also be considered irresponsible if there is a high chance of death and others are relying on them.\n\nI struggle to think of a sport that is too dangerous to be considered a sport. I think it is also important to consider the definition of the term sport. A sport is an activity requiring physical exertion in which an individual or team competes against other individuals or teams for the entertainment of others. The definition does not question whether or not an activity is too high risk. Considering this, risk does not make an activity any less of a sport.\n\nAll things considered, I believe that all sports have value and should not be discounted because of an elevated amount of risk.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the line between what is considered \"risky\" is relative. As a rock climber myself, I can say that rock climbing, when practiced with the right gear, is an exceptionally safe sport. While it is possible to put yourself in an extremely risky situation, most climbers are aware of the risks and take precautions to ensure their safety. For example, a climber that uses a harness, rope, and other critical gear will minimize their risk of injury. To fall in rock climbing is not particularly dangerous when said harness, rope, and carabiners (which are bolted to the rock wall) are used. Falling is considered part of the experience. I should also add that the climber should have a partner who is experienced and trained in the proper belay techniques.\n \nExtreme sports, particularly rock climbing (since that is where my experience lies), in my opinion, are extreme only when a climber chooses to climb with no ropes or harness. There are those who do this and have gained much media attention. I believe this type of climbing should be looked at differently than the more traditional climbing with ropes and harnesses. Indeed I feel that free solo climbers who forgo ropes are begging for disaster. \n\nOverall, I don't think it's necessarily selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing as long as safety precautions are taken and the climb is executed safely and responsibly.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there is no such thing as a sport that is too dangerous to be regarded as one. I invoke this argument in the spirit of the claims that John Stuart Mill famously made in his book: \"On Liberty\". Mill argued that the individual is always sovereign over his own body. Mill went on further to claim that there was a distinction between offense and harm. Admittedly, a spectator may be offended by a gory spectacle he may behold at a bullfighting ring, yet if the spectator suffers no physical injury, it is difficult to argue that he has been harmed. However, an important exception may be made in the case of a child who may suffer from psychological trauma under such circumstances. By contrast, this is a highly unlikely possibility in the case of an adult spectator. Provided that the bullfighter has entered the ring voluntarily, it stands to reason that no moral transgression has occurred. The same holds true for practitioners of other extreme sports, such as base jumping, swimming with sharks, mixed martial arts, and so on. It is the prerogative of the individual to make his own decisions about activities in which he wishes to engage. As long as he does not end up harming someone else, who are we to judge? Therefore, I hold that it is not selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I think that college athletes should be paid. College athletics at a higher level eventually becomes monetized, so athletes quickly become commodities and are already being exploited through commercialization. Because of this, I think it is only fair that the main \"product\" being commercialized, in this case the athletes' abilities, should be able to benefit financially from it, at least to some degree. College athletes sometimes sacrifice their bodies and their times for a small chance at monetary gain in a professional league, but I think college athletes should be rewarded quite fairly and evenly for their work while they are in college, regardless of how successful they'll be at a professional level.\n\nAs Cody J. McDavis writes: \"A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\" I think he brings up a good point, but the solution to that issue is to establish a flat base salary for all college athletes, adjusted for the sport. I'm not advocating for such an immense amount of money to financially drain a school, but enough to allow for college athletes to focus on their sport and education, rather than deal with financial insecurity and a greater level of exploitation. Additionally, there needs to be regulation in place to ensure that the money is being spent properly and going to the athletes, and not just the university's bottom line.\n\nThere will obviously be many complications and downsides in providing monetary compensation to college athletes, most notably the effect it will have on athletic programs in lower-tier schools, and the possible destabilization of some leagues. But it quickly becomes a debate between which is worse, the possible destabilization of some schools or athletics programs, or the exploitation of college athletes.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, college athletes should absolutely be paid a fair working wage for every single game that they play on behalf of the college (especially if it\u2019s televised and otherwise monetized for financial gain, either by the NCAA or by the college themselves). It is worth mentioning, however that Cody J. McDavis makes an extremely persuasive argument that paying student-athletes would have negative consequences for the overall college sports landscape across all levels of competition. In spite of this, I firmly believe that as we would with any issue, it\u2019s also important to look at the benefits of paying college athletes for the talents that they contribute rather than just focusing on the negative side of the argument.\n\nFirstly, paying college athletes would provide players with the financial compensation that they deserve for their hard work and dedication to their sport. It\u2019s no secret that not all college athletes come from high money backgrounds, and these athletes may struggle significantly to make ends meet while balancing schoolwork and athletics (even though tuition is covered by the program). Furthermore, paying college athletes would make college sports even more competitive than they already are by allowing student-athletes to view their team as a financial opportunity rather than purely recreational activity. Paying college athletes would also create a more equitable system for students, as universities and the NCAA earn millions of dollars from college sports each year. Providing financial support to college athletes would allow these athletes to focus on their education and athletic pursuits without worrying about their financial situation. \n\nOn the flipside, I can absolutely recognize that there are negative drawbacks to providing financial compensation to college student athletes! One of the primary arguments brought up by McDavis is that paying college athletes would create a bidding war for top talent that many universities couldn\u2019t afford to keep up with, thus creating an even bigger divide between lower budget and higher budget programs. It would also make it more difficult for lower-budget universities to compete and attract student athletes, since they would be unable to offer attractive financial incentives on top of their already existing scholarship opportunities.\n\nAll in all, I think that college athletes should be paid for their hard work and dedication to their respective sports, however this should be done with extreme caution and consideration of the potential negative consequences (such as creating even bigger divides between budget programs). As with anything, there are plenty of methods to mitigate the potential divides between program budgets to allow student athletes to be compensated for their time. It would take effort on behalf of the NCAA to consider methods to mitigate any potential drawbacks, however, I firmly believe that this is absolutely something that should be done.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, colleges are making money off the backs of student athletes, and the athletes are paying a price. This is especially true in big ticket sports such as basketball and football. The NCAA does not permit college athletes to be compensated for their hard work and dedication, though the revenues generated by their success do make it possible for universities to provide scholarships and other perks. Mr. McDavis argues that paying athletes would lead to a handful programs fighting over top athletes, but isn't this already true? While colleges are not allowed to pay athletes, recruiters from colleges with more money do entice players by showing them luxuries accommodations and the potential for a better college experience than schools with less money. Athletes who bring in big money for their colleges should be compensated for their work. \n\nThat being said, I do agree that paying college athletes could present certain downsides and difficulties. College athletes are not professionals. They are offered scholarships in return for playing, and they should be working toward a college degree. If colleges start offering money, athletes could become more focused on money than their academic career. Of course, many athletes leave college early to go pro, so this point doesn't make a strong case for not paying athletes. I do think that if college athletes are paid, there should be parameters such as minimum grades and playing time, so that they remain focused on academics while they are in college. \n\nIn recent years, it has become more widely known that athletes are suffering from tragic debilitating conditions later in life, most likely caused by injuries they sustained when they were young. Some athletes have sued schools due to these injuries, but many are struggling to pay for the medical help they need. Paying athletes while they are college could help to protect them in the future, particularly when it comes to injury and lifelong wellness. It is fairly common to hear about former college athletes who need multiple knee surgeries as young adults. These \"wear and tear\" injuries begin as early as high school, but kids keep playing because they love their sport. Some athletes play through injuries because they don't want to be benched or sidelined. Paying athletes a salary could give them the incentive to report injuries, rest, and seek medical attention.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the reason people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals is that in the eyes of humans, animals are blameless. Animals are not seen as culpable for their own misfortune, and so we tend to feel a greater sense of pity and empathy for them. Even in the case of observing human suffering of those we have no personal connection to, I think we as humans subconsciously are able to craft some sort of excuse for that human's suffering. That isn't to say that they \"deserved it,\" but our brains are able to process the image of human suffering more easily because it can contemplate a reason the human might be suffering, contrasted to animals, where any suffering is seen as unjust.\n\nIt really doesn't surprise me at all that 40 percent of people would choose their own pet over a foreign tourist. If anything, I am surprised the number isn't higher. People derive an immense amount of joy from their pets, and I don't think it would be an overstatement that many many pet owners prefer the company of their pets over the company of other humans. The fact that the study used \"foreign\" tourists is interesting as well, because it speaks to the same sense of connection that humans have to their pets. When you don't have a connection to someone, it is easier to distance yourself from them and feel less empathy for their suffering--unfortunate as it is, the \"foreign\" modifier attenuates that connection even further.\n\nI am pretty conflicted on the question of whether it's \"wrong\" to focus on animal welfare while people are suffering. On the one hand, it seems objectively the case that we should focus on alleviating human suffering as a priority. On the other, there are two points. One, is there really a scientific basis for why we should be prioritizing human suffering over that of animals? Especially given the above point about their blamelessness? I realize how absurd that sounds, but from a scientific standpoint it seems worth exploring. The second point is a question--why can't we have both? It's not as if it's necessarily a zero-sum game--maybe if we prioritize animal welfare, that actually alleviates some of the human suffering in certain contexts--and even if it didn't, I'm not sure why we couldn't work concurrently toward solving both problems.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, many people are trained from birth to view humans with suspicion and fear, while they are encouraged to view animals as cute and innocent.  Much of our world is pre-built to put others at a disadvantage, and in order to justify the protection of that system we have to come up with excuses, like saying poor people are just lazy, or migrants are just greedy. When you tell someone a story about a man being beaten, their first question is usually, \"Why? What did he do?\" That type of mentality doesn't typically exist for animals. Even when an animal is struck because it bit someone, or put down because it killed someone, the general consensus is that the animal didn't truly deserve it. \"It didn't know what it was doing,\" we say. \"What did they expect? That's what animals do.\" Whenever an animal is harmed, it's generally seen as an act of cruelty that warrants punishment - regardless of the reasons behind it.  \n\nThere are some notable exceptions, however. When Jaws came out, there was a huge increase in shark hunting, despite there being no increase in shark attacks. The psychological reasons for this seem obvious though, and only further reinforce the idea that there is an inherent empathy towards animals that simply doesn't exist for humans.  Jaws portrayed the shark as an active antagonist, a villain deliberate in its cruelty and calculated in its attacks.  It wasn't killing for food, it was killing for pleasure. Ironically, since the movie \"humanized\" the shark's violence, it became less deserving of sympathy.  \n\nWhen it comes to the question of focusing on animal welfare over human welfare, the morality is equally complex.  Many animals that are seen as food are treated horribly, and people either don't care, take pleasure in their slaughtering, or are appalled.  There are many animal rights activists who advocate for more humane treatment, or even for veganism to end \"animal genocide\".  While there's nothing wrong with paying attention to and caring about, animal welfare, it's important to remember that the violence and suffering of animals is still, in most cases, far surpassed by the violence and suffering done to humans. And in many cases, better treatment of animals (going vegan, for example) can actually result in more human suffering. Popular vegan alternatives to meat or animal by-products are produced by human labor.  Labor which is often underpaid, exploitative, and even dangerous.  In the wildfires of 2020, for example, Americans were confronted with images of migrant farmers forced to continue picking avocados as a massive fire loomed in the background.  Animal activists who buy agave instead of honey don't seem to stop and consider that, while honey bees are not harmed or killed for their honey, bats crucial to Mexico's ecosystem are often killed (purposely or through pesticide drive-by) because they live near the agave plants.\n\n\nSo to answer the original question: Is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Of course not. Competitive misery helps no one, and it's easy to get drawn into arguments about who is suffering the most instead of helping anything or anyone. But putting the welfare of animals above the welfare of humans is just as wrong as putting any one group's well-being over anothers.", "path": "./logs/pilot/c53ff0cbac3b48238a07e1850344ef16.jsonl", "prompt": "Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals should not be deprived of basic rights and humane treatment, regardless of the suffering humans are enduring. Furthermore, pets are dependent on us for their basic needs, and thus we have an ethical responsibility to ensure that their welfare is taken care of. This in turn makes them vulnerable to cruelty and neglect, which is why protecting animal welfare is so important. When we adopt a pet into our home, its protection and our care is our responsibility. Furthermore, animals have a much smaller capacity to advocate for their own rights, which is why animal welfare organizations should be supported and empowered. In fact, learning to care for animals can lead to greater empathy and respect for all beings, human or otherwise.\n\nThere is also a difference in scale between some of these problems.

It would not surprise me to find out that people are more empathetic to a story of a dog being abused, versus a story of a human being abused in a similar way. We generally consider animals like dogs to be pets, so we feel a greater need to protect them. The idea that researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist honestly surprised me, considering I thought that number would be much higher. Although most people tend to consider a human life to be \"worth\" more than that of a dog, I simply find it hard to imagine that only 40% would choose the life of a stranger over the life of their pet.\n\nI think that one thing that needs to be taken note of is the fact that we are also more desensitized to human suffering than we are to animal suffering, so hearing a story about a human being abused might evoke a lesser response than hearing a story about a dog being abused simply due to our own desensitization. This would explain why people might feel a greater need to protect animals than humans.\n\nI wouldn't say that it is necessarily wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering, because both can be focused on individually.

Animals, especially pets, are dependent on us and have no ability to speak up for their own needs, so it is important that we be advocates for their well-being.

Kindness of any kind should be supported and there is no sense in gatekeeping one form of kindness in favor of other. \n\nAt the same time, it is important to recognize that human suffering is a very real and pressing issue. The difference is that this is an issue to be extensively solved on a global scale and the solution involves both societal changes and efforts on the individual level.

Learning to show kindness and empathy towards animals can help us become more empathetic individuals and may even contribute towards our society as a whole moving towards broader, more sustainable solutions for both human and animal suffering.  \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that focusing on animal welfare when humans are suffering is not wrong.

{"essay": "It is indeed surprising to hear that a study found research subjects to be more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult experiencing a similar fate. Additionally, the finding that 40 percent of people would choose to save their pet dog over a foreign tourist raises thought-provoking questions about human empathy and the value placed on animal welfare. There are several factors that may contribute to the heightened empathy towards animals compared to humans.\n\nOne possible explanation is that animals are often perceived as innocent and vulnerable beings that are incapable of defending themselves. This perception evokes a protective instinct in many individuals, leading to a greater emotional response when animals suffer. Animals are also often seen as dependent on humans for their well-being, which may further enhance feelings of responsibility and empathy.\n\nAnother factor could be the emotional distance and complexity associated with human suffering. Humans are capable of expressing their emotions and communicating their pain through language and various coping mechanisms. This ability to articulate and rationalize their suffering might create a sense of detachment or desensitization among observers. On the other hand, animals may communicate their pain non-verbally, relying on their expressions and body language, which can elicit a more immediate emotional response.\n \nFurthermore, media portrayal and cultural influences may play a role in shaping empathetic responses. Stories and images of animal cruelty often receive significant attention in the media, leading to increased awareness and emotional reactions. In contrast, human suffering, particularly in distant or unfamiliar contexts, may be underreported or receive less prominence, leading to a relative lack of public awareness and empathy.\n\nWhile it is important to recognize and address human suffering, focusing on animal welfare is not inherently wrong. The well-being of animals and humans are not mutually exclusive, and there is value in advocating for both causes. Promoting animal welfare can contribute to a more compassionate and ethical society overall, as it reflects our ability to extend empathy and care beyond human boundaries. Furthermore, initiatives aimed at animal welfare often intersect with broader environmental and ecological concerns, which have implications for human well-being as well.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to maintain a balanced approach and ensure that resources and efforts are appropriately allocated to address both animal and human suffering. It is not a matter of disregarding human suffering but rather recognizing the interconnectedness of various issues and striving for a comprehensive approach to empathy and justice. By fostering empathy towards both animals and humans, we can work towards a more compassionate world where all living beings are treated with dignity and respect.\n \n\nIn conclusion, although many people exhibit greater empathy towards animals than humans, focusing on animal welfare is not necessarily wrong.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I feel very uncomfortable when there are racial stereotypes depicted on screen or in a book. Whenever that appears, I almost always switch off or close the book and look for something else to watch or read. Racism or bigotry of any kind has no place in the world today, and I don't want to support it by consuming it in any form. By making this small step each individual can fight their own small battle in a much larger war against hate. \n\nSomething else I really hate seeing depicted is the stereotypically dumb characters. It feels like the writer(s) are going for a cheap laugh and not putting much effort into their characters. To me, it just feels like lazy writing and completely undermines the other characters in the work as well as the work the writer(s) put into developing the character. I'd rather see something creative, thought-provoking, and entertaining than a tired clich\u00e9. Something I have also noticed is that as a series goes on, characters who were previously thought of as smart, or at least normal, get dumber, like Kevin in the office, Joey in Friends, or Britta in Community. It always makes me cringe when they are lacking basic knowledge.\n\nBuilding on that, some stereotypical characters I don't enjoy watching are the nerd who's actually pretty under their glasses, the jock who is actually smart, the loner who eventually gets his girl, or any other characters that feel like cookie-cutter templates instead of unique individuals. There have already been so many stories told about these stereotypes that it feels like I have already seen the movie when I see it represented again. I would much rather watch something that tries something different and is innovative, even if is not as good as stories that follow these boring stereotypes. On top of that, these movies have already been told perfectly by former directors or authors and do not need to be attempted to improve on. \n\nI would not watch or read something because of stereotypical characters when they are portrayed in a way that I find offensive because I don't want to perpetuate the cycle of ignorance. I also wouldn't watch or read something if it was offensive to someone because I believe everyone should have access to stories that are respectful of their race, gender, sexual orientation, and any other form of identity.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I think that Jessica Huang from Fresh Off the Boat is the one stereotypical character that makes me cringe. I am not wholly against stereotypical characters in books, on TV, movies, etc. but I do not enjoy it when the characters entire personality is based off a stereotype. The satire is good, but in moderation, as is everything else in life. Too much of one thing is never good and I think Jessica's character is an over exaggeration of an Asian mother.\n\nBeing an Asian myself, I am aware of the stereotypes that come with the race. I do not support making fun of people using stereotypes, but I think using it for satire in a non-hurtful way is good entertainment. Having a good balance is key in making sure people don't become offended or just overall, uninterested.\n\nHowever, I would not watch or read something that heavily relies on stereotypical characters if it was offensive or mean or just makes the character's whole identity that stereotype. For instance, in almost every scene that I have scene with Jessica, she is an overbearing, controlling, unrealistic Asian mother/woman. While those stereotypes are common in the Asian community, I think that the fact that her whole identity on the show is just showcasing her negative traits and not some positive Asian stereotypes, makes me cringe. \n\nThat being said, if the show portrayed more positive Asian stereotypes like intelligence, hard-working, etc. I would be more tolerant of her character. There is such a thing as a good stereotype and I feel like other viewers feel the same when they come across her character because with her there is no balance of her good and bad qualities. Personally, I began to dislike her character because of the overuse of the negative qualities she'd display. \n\nHer character constantly highlighted all the stereotypical negative traits of an Asian woman, wife, and mother. She was constantly nagging, talking down on people, having unrealistic expectations of her children, comparing children, etc. Some may say \"Well this is the reality of some of the toxicity in the Asian community\", but why are we always quick to highlight the bad and not the good? It makes for good TV when characters are relatable, but they don't have to only be relatable in the worst ways.\n\nOverall, I don't think that every stereotypical character is cringe-worthy and can be entertaining, but when it's overdone, it ruins the whole perception of the character. A character's identity is not just defined by their race or ethnicity, so I believe that the people who create these characters should be conscious of that and learn that there's a fine line between racial satire and just offensiveness. Writers should consider how much good stereotypes can go a long way in the eyes of the viewers.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion,\n\nA cringeworthy character is one who proclaims to the audience how he ought to interpret the story, whether with applause, sadness, or something in-between. Most often today, the point is to make a declaration on morality, what is wrong and what is right. Characters who do this are usually a cringeworthy portrayal of a specific race, gender, or culture. Consider any group society deems marginalized and there's a story talking about the impact of that oppression and the wrongness thereof. Within that story is a character or multiple characters who hammer in the point. In the end, the viewer says to his television screen, \"Okay. I get it already!\"\n\nThis modern phenomenon of embarrassment is most noticeable in movies, television, and books. In fact, one of the chief issues with modern Hollywood is the need to tell, rather than show. Disney, Universal, Paramount Pictures, all of the big and no-name companies have followed suite. The point they make is that stereotypes are wrong (such as gender roles). However, this point is espoused by someone who is the archetype of the generalization. Not the generalization they are advocating against, but a generalization of their own making. The housewife becomes the badass heroine who doesn't need a man. Today, such leading ladies are a dime a dozen. The irony and cringe worthiness comes from them saying not to do one thing, while doing that very thing - generalizing.\n\nMost readers and viewers would agree that an offensive portrayal of a certain group in society is something to avoid. However, each audience member in some way participates in generalizing. Everyone associates groups of people with ideas, whether that group is based on sex, age, race, or religion. The cringeworthy character tells you that your ideas are wrong, at least if not in alignment with what he proclaims. But that leaves the audience with a question, one that can't be answered by a fictional character. Why is he right and I'm wrong?\n\nWhat the cringeworthy character gets wrong is that categorizing people makes us human. This is part of being human and our way of understanding the world. These categories become symbolic, information to use for every new encounter. Not because we are hateful at our core, but because we do not process every novel situation like children. For example, a woman who's been abused knows what kind of men to avoid. That is something the cringeworthy character may appreciate, but his values sometimes differ from the audience's.\n\nIn the end, it is up to the reader or viewer to make their own decisions about what is an acceptable or unacceptable portrayal of a certain group. What one person finds cringeworthy may not bother another, and what one finds truthful could be labeled as a lie by someone else. While truth is not relative, opinions certainly are and telling someone how to think without the evidence to support takes away from every movie, book, and show where the cringeworthy character appears. Art is meant to imitate life. There is no life without categories. And therefore, art cannot exists without them as well. \n ", "path": "./logs/pilot/826147c10a98425985287558ba845157.jsonl", "prompt": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why?

{"essay": "\nThere have been many stereotyped characters in various forms of media that made me deeply uncomfortable, and even made me feel guilty about continuing to engage with the story.  I can't, for example, watch Breakfast at Tiffany's without feeling disgusted at the portrayal of the Japanese character, Mr. Yunioshi. Probably one of the most infamous instances of yellow-face in Hollywood history, not only is he played by a white actor, but his portrayal is filled with exaggerated Asian stereotypes, a ridiculous accent, and cheap jokes. My enjoyment of Audrey Hepburn's performance can't outweigh my deep sense of discomfort with Mickey Rooney's awful presence. \n\n I believe media affects how people perceive real people, and any stereotype that can be deemed offensive is hurtful even when it comes to 'entertainment'. Audiences may be willing to overlook the presence of Mr. Yunioshi if they like the movie, but to do that requires them to tacitly accept the dehumanizing stereotypes that come with it.  It requires us to shrug and say, \"It's not that bad,\" or else confront our own complicity. What we often fail to realize is that the acceptance of these performances gives a kind of permission to future writers to create their own stereotypes. This is exactly why I'm so disturbed whenever I see these dangerous representations: they have a real impact on future media, and on how we see and treat people in our daily lives. I have been to towns with majority white populations and had to field questions about what it's like to live in the Bay Area 'surrounded by all those Asians'.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I cringe with the stereotypical damsel in distress character who is too weak without the help of a man. This type of character is often portrayed as a beautiful, naive woman who needs overprotective male characters to save her from harm.  Sadly, this type of character is seen way too often and gives young girls the false narrative that a man is needed in order for her to be safe or succeed. It reinforces gender roles that are outdated and damaging to society.  At this point, women are just as capable as a man.  While I may not completely write off a movie or book based on this type of character, I would only continue to follow along with hope that somewhere along the lines she saves herself and realizes she can do this on her own.\nAdditionally, I cringe when there are characters that are stereotyped based on their ethnicity. When stories rely on tired, dated tropes or unflattering stereotypes, it can make for very uncomfortable viewing or reading.  The reality is, our world now is filled with people of multiple ethnicities and mixed ethnicities.  By portraying characters in this old fashioned light is not only offensive, but also makes it hard to explain to younger generations how people ever thought such a thing was acceptable.  I cannot give my support to any story that simplifies people and their culture by relying on stereotypes instead of creating real, multi-dimensional characters.\nWhile I am not someone who is part of the woke, cancel culture narrative, there are certain areas that I cringe when watching or reading.  Having the dumb blonde with big boobs who is only needed as arm candy for a man rather than for her own thoughts as a main character, it becomes very cringy to watch.  Similarly, when you are making fun of a race or ethnicity by only showing negative views, I think you are propagating certain beliefs.  I understand that  certain characters were at one point considered funny, but we now live in 2023 where characters need to be multifaceted and have their own identity.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the stereotypical characters that make me cringe is the depiction of the superior white male in movies. In many television shows, movies and books the white male is always depicted as superior compared to the other races or ethnicities. This can make me feel uncomfortable and offended at times as it perpetuates the idea of white supremacy. White supremacy has been a modern issue that has led to many concerns from other communities that have been considered secondary. In many movies the white male has always been the hero who saved the day while other groups that include the Asians, Latina and African Americans being the victims or the ones who perceive the white male as their \"savior.\" There are many stories that have had other ethnicities and races as heroes or heroines but have not been depicted appropriately.\nOne example that comes to my mind that shows the stereotypical characters that Hollywood displays is the pharaohs of Egypt. In many movies that show the success of the Egyptians the individuals that play the pharaohs are usually white while historically the Egyptians were never from the white race. Egyptians origins can be traced back to the African continent. There are many actors with the African origin that can be used to depict the pharaohs but are not used in Hollywood movies. I usually cringe because Hollywood has always been a political tool over the years since the cold wars between Americans and the Soviets and the trend never stopped. However, it is time that changes are made so that the white man does not dominate the screen.\nThe white male depiction has not only been offensive to other races or ethnicities but also the way the females are depicted on screens. Females are usually depicted as weaker and dependent on a man (usually the white male) to save the day which is not only wrong but degrading. In addition, there is the sexual depiction of the female character. In most movies, the female lead is usually sexualized to attract viewers, even if her role does not require it. Such depiction can always be seen in the spy movies that include James Bond, where there is always a sexualized female costar. The female star can either be white, African American or from other ethnicities. One also notes that the male white actor is always the hero.\nIn sum, even though there is the entertainment aspect of movies, books or television shows that depict white male actors as superior, I am not a fan of such portrayals. Thus, I avoid interacting with such material and watch or read stories that have genuine depiction of races and ethnicities through a culturally aware perspective. Even though such depictions are rare because of the low economic level, there are still gems that have stories with appropriate representation.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, any character that is written to promote a narrow, one-dimensional view of a certain demographic or group-- such as women, people of color, LGBTQ is stereotypical and negative. While some recent movies claim to promote representation, they make rather sweeping assumptions about it, which I believe are not worth anyone's time. The French film, \"The Closet\" makes me cringe a little because it made the women appear as a shallow stereotype. Movies or books that tries to reflect the perspective, experiences, or realities of a group of people from a single perspective is offensive. \n\nIf something has an offensive portrayal of someone that perpetuates harmful stereotypes, I would not watch or read it. This is because it provides a false narrative that is misleading to the readers and the person that has been negatively portrayed. While I understand that most books and movies try to allign with the shallow expectations of the audience, they are not providing a compelling or complex representation, which makes them unsatisfying. Movies that address highly debated topics that involve women, gays, and lesbians should be able to open up spaces for new voices instead of putting them at physical risk by portraying them negatively. \n\nTo summarise, any character that promotes a negative stereotype about a group of people makes me cringe, and I would not watch or read something. This is because I believe it is unfair to make generalizations based on your assumptions and then try to force them down other people's throats. Stereotypes are demeaning because they often make people feel like they do not belong or make their experiences feel less important to others. While movies and books with stereotypes might sound interesting and be seen as fun, I find them condescending, which is why I will not watch or read anything that promotes negative stereotypes about a person or a group of people. \n\nBy the way, I believe that in a world where inclusivity is promoted, stereotypes in movies can only be termed an act of hypocrisy. This is because these stereotypes hurt oppressed and marginalised groups more than they fully represent them. So, it is not right to engage in any creative work that portrays someone in a negative light.
