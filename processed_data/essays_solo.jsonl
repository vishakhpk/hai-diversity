{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, school is a place where students are equipped with the tools to handle whatever life throws at them. Mindfulness is a pretty big umbrella term covering a lot of different techniques like meditation and yoga. So the argument to teach it in schools should be decided by whether or not we believe it is a tool that students would benefit from.\n\nSpeaking for myself, mindfulness has been nothing but positive. Sometimes, we are overwrought by emotions and unable to think straight. At others, we might be just seeking a safe mind space to think about ourselves and focus on what we are feeling at that moment. From experience, these types of situations are when I think mindfulness helped the most. \n\nThe world today is very fast paced and competitive. Students are put in such situations because they are faced with immense pressure very early in their lives. Learning mindfulness at that age can only be helpful because it helps them deal with these. Moreover, the practise of such techniques is a lifelong endeavour so starting early is a benefit. Like other things, school should be a place to sample knowledge from all walks of life. Maybe some of them don't like it? That's fine. Let them try it out for themselves and opt out if it doesn't help.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, practicing mindfulness can be extremely helpful. The act of being mindful of decisions, situations, and arising problems can help you get ahead of things before they become hurtful to yourself or your surroundings.  Meditating can also be helpful in the right context, but it's not for everyone either. \n\nBeing mindful of your reactions, thoughts, feelings, and even verbal responses can assist in mitigating potential problems. I have often found myself coming down with \"foot-in-mouth\" syndrome where I don't stop to think about what I'm saying - I just say it.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, schools should teach mindfulness. It is vital to an individual's success in life to remain in control of their emotions and thoughts. One of the largest problems people face today is not understanding how to control emotions and thoughts, leading to confusion and people wandering through life. Mental health continues to be a plague throughout our youth. Equipping students with the faculties to care for themselves would aid the mental health crisis.\n\nOne can not serve the greater whole if they, themselves, are not well. You often hear that you shouldn't help others if you cannot help yourself. Teaching mindfulness would be of great benefit not only to students but to society as a whole. School is full of stressful situations: romantic relationships, final exams, homework, and trying out for a sports team. Learning mindfulness would create students that can work through these situations, remaining in control of their feelings and thoughts. After using these skills in school, students can apply these skills to the real world. Relationships, careers, and raising a family or just a few examples of where people can utilize mindfulness to create more favorable outcomes.\n\nI was not taught mindfulness during my studies in grade school. However, having studied philosophy at university, I was able to pick up many of the skills that one might get in a mindfulness class. I believe that mindfulness is one of the most important things I learned at university. The way these skills helped me navigate through school and into my career makes me wish I had always possessed these skills! There is no doubt that all students would benefit from learning these skills.\n\nA healthy mind is just as important as a healthy body. A healthy mind lets us truly be ourselves by allowing us to be more confident in maneuvering through life. Someone who doesn't practice mindfulness is overly emotional, letting obstacles frustrate them and ultimately handicapping themselves. That is why mindfulness must be taught to students today.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, mindfulness can be a highly instrumental tool for fostering mental health and achieving a balance between work and life. The American culture is highly competitive, which means that most Americans tend to prioritize professional success over other aspects of life such as personal well-being, interpersonal relationships, and spiritual pursuits. Furthermore, Americans who are highly educated tend to have a very skeptical attitude toward the practices of meditation and mindfulness. They tend to see these endeavors as representations of religious mysticism. However, they would be well advised to understand that while these endeavors have ties to the religion of Buddhism, one can pursue these activities without believing in any religious dogmas. This is one fundamental difference between this sort of spiritual endeavor and those that one typically encounters in the Judeo-Christian faiths. \n\nI first tried meditation as an adolescent when I read a book by Sogyal Rinpoche: \"The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying\". I have straightened out my back and pursued meditation in the specific posture that the author of the book described. I instantly began feeling a sensation of calm, peace of mind, and relaxation in my body. Thereafter, I found that my ability to focus has enhanced a great deal, and I handled distressing situations with much greater ease. I have thoroughly enjoyed this experience and continued to read the book with the special purpose of studying various meditative exercises that the author recommended. I certainly would recommend this practice to others, as meditation can benefit people from a broad variety of cultural backgrounds. It is not necessary for them to subscribe to a rigid belief system in order to reap the same benefits. In fact, the opposite is the case: meditation allows people to pursue spiritual growth unencumbered by religious dogma, doctrinaire ideology, or adherence to rigid rules that may appear to many as implausible. \n\nI believe that meditation has a place in schools because it does not require any religious commitment. In the United States, teachers are prohibited from promoting a particular religious point of view, which is why prayer is banned. The rationale for such a prohibition is understandable, as prayer requires students to recite certain religious verses and presuppose belief in particular theological concepts. By contrast, meditation can be practiced without such presuppositions or consideration of certain religious texts. In contrast to the Judeo-Christian religions, students can receive the benefits of meditation as a spiritual practice without also accepting the drawbacks that one typically associates with spiritual or religious activities.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, schools should indeed teach mindfulness. In this day and age where distractions come from every which way, whether from our phones, computers, or any number of other ways, myriad forms of media barrage them with information. I would argue that too many forms of media and information do not equal freedom. I would similarly argue that too many choices and or media exposure creates an overload that is paralyzing and thus counter-productive. This is where teaching mindfulness in school can be useful. Because the concept of mindfulness is to still the mind and focus on the mind, breathing, self, and the moment. If utilized as intended, mindfulness is a way to filter out all of the information that may not be relevant. \n\nIn my own personal experience practicing mindfulness, I found that I was able to take a step back and regroup. This regrouping afforded me clarity that was instrumental in a better problem-solving experience overall. Thus, I could separate the proverbial wheat from the chaff of everyday distractions, worries, and ruminations.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that teaching today's youth to focus on being in the moment is arguably as important a skill as learning to read and write! I might also venture to say that with the constant inundation of media of all sorts, a high number of today's youth may have been diagnosed with ADHD and/or ADD as a result of the barrage of media they are exposed to. Therefore, I believe it is imperative that children be exposed to the concepts of mindfulness at a young age as well as through their formative years.", "path": "./logs/pilot/50ac97df85aa412ab8feae8398965f97.jsonl", "prompt": "Should Schools Teach Mindfulness?\n\nHave you ever tried mindfulness or meditation, practices that focus on the present moment and being aware of your thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations?

{"essay": "\nMindfulness is a practice with tons of evidence-backed research to promote anti-stress and good health to the mind, body, and spirit. Working in the mental health field I have seen the profound effects that mindfulness can bring to students, teachers, parents, and folks of all ages. Focusing on the present moment can greatly decrease the anxiety that we feel about the future. This is ideal for students because when we decrease stress we will see higher test scores and better academic performance.  \n\nI have practiced mindfulness myself and found it to be one of the best methods for healing the body from anxiety, stomach problems, headaches, and chronic pain. The five-sense method is a process used in clinical therapy to help patients struggling with anxiety regain focus and feel more grounded. During an anxiety attack, it is common for children to become distracted from their bodies and \u201clost in their thoughts and fears\u201d. The five-sense method has one list of five things they can see, four things they can touch, three things they can hear, two things they can smell, and one thing they can taste. This helps bring kids back to their bodies and can provide a distraction from their current anxiety.\n\nThe pandemic greatly affected our students in schools across the nation and it is no surprise that our children are being directly affected. While some adults may ask \u201cWhat do kids even have to worry about?\u201d Over 4.4 million children in the United States alone have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Children not only have school to worry about but they are humans too and have stress related to family, making friends, the future, current events, and even their own health. With online schooling and increased barriers to accessing resources, this number only continues to grow. Utilizing mindfulness in schools can greatly reduce the pressure that our students face in classrooms on a daily basis.\u00a0\n\nStarting off the day where teachers promote a daily meditation or lesson on emotional health can elevate our students to handle stress better in the future. This could help increase productivity, improve academics, and influence the social skills of our children. Having goals and staying future-oriented is important, but this can take a great toll on children with a predisposition to anxiety and other mental health problems. Mindfulness can help children become more aware of their thoughts, feelings, and sensations giving them a greater sense of control on how to handle problems that may arise. Not only is this a great tool to help children who struggle with these problems, but it\u2019s also a great tool for prevention by decreasing the overall stress load students feel. Teachers and school administration can also practice mindfulness which will support a more healthy, grounded, and productive school community.\u00a0\n\n\n\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/8d48038fc60845219dae139f11e534e7.jsonl", "prompt": "Should Schools Teach Mindfulness?\n\nHave you ever tried mindfulness or meditation, practices that focus on the present moment and being aware of your thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, practicing mindfulness can be extremely beneficial. I have practiced meditation in the past but do not currently. The only times I practice meditation are when I am feeling particularly stressed or overwhelmed. It is not something I do on a regular basis.\n\nI didn't know how to start meditating on my own, because I had never been taught so I downloaded a free app off the internet that leads you through meditations. It would have been beneficial for me to have learned how to meditate through school so I did not have to download an app, but it was not a large inconvenience.\n\nIn my experience, meditation has been extremely helpful for me when I do it. It helps to calm me down and feel centered. I typically do it in the morning so it puts me in a better head space to tackle the day. It also helps me to be more productive. When I do not meditate, I typically sit in bed and look at my phone for half an hour or more. But when I meditate, as soon as my alarm goes off I sit up, queue the meditation app on my phone, meditate for as long as I feel is necessary, then start my day. \n\nI have also found that when I meditate, I am more focused throughout the day and have a much better attention span. In addition, meditating has helped me to realize past mistakes and how I could have acted differently and been a better person, friend, and student. \n\nI think meditation could have a space in school learning but not too much. I think it would be useful for kids to know the basics so that later in life if they feel the need to do it, or just want to try it, they have a jumping-off point. It could also be helpful for kids who want to start meditating immediately and don't have their own phones to download an app as I did. It would also be helpful for kids who want to start meditating but do not have reliable internet access.\n\nHowever, I am hesitant to say it should take a large part in school as it would more than likely take time away from P.E. which in my opinion is more important. It is important for kids to learn about physical exercise and even more important to actually take part in physical exercises and develop healthy exercise habits. \n\nMeditation can be highly effective in improving an individual's state of mind.

{"essay": "\nMindfulness or meditation are proven methods that allow a person to relax and reach a more peaceful state. While some people regularly use meditation or mindfulness throughout their daily lives, others find it to be a useful tool when they feel stressed or anxious. I fall into the second group. I have never been good at mindfulness when I am already calm or relaxed, but when I feel anxious or in an extreme state of stress, like an oncoming panic attack, I use mindfulness practices to bring my emotions back to a more steady place.\nAs a parent of teens and a high school teacher, I have introduced the practice of mindfulness to other people. When my own children are anxious or having a panic attack, we can even do mindfulness over the phone to help them settle down. They focus on one physical object around them, like a book or their car keys. Then we go through all their sensory emotions, and they describe the object in terms of their emotions. We might skip tasting their car keys, though. One of my kids does better with mindful breathing. They inhale for 4 seconds, hold their breath for 4 seconds, then blow out for 4 seconds. This method helps slow the heart rate and breathing rate so that they can return to a calm state.\nAs a teacher, I have used methods like this with my students. If I am one-on-one with a student, I can walk them through a mindfulness process or breathing technique. However, if I am working with my whole class, I approach it differently. I might play some soft music or even white noise. I've shown videos on the projector, like a coral reef or other nature scenes with the music. Students clear everything off their desks and just take 3-5 minutes to relax, breathe comfortably, and put aside their stresses for a few minutes. This is especially helpful at high-demand academic times, like standardized testing and graduation.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I believe that schools should teach mindfulness, whether it be optional or required is at the school's discretion, but I think that it should be readily available to students. I strongly agree that everyone should practice some form of mindfulness as it promotes a healthier lifestyle by learning to be present and think through whatever may be going on in that moment; particularly moments of stress, anxiety, etc. I think that having learning opportunities readily available in schools can help aid a society where more people are learning to deal and cope with negative situations in healthier ways.\n\nI think that it is important for individuals to be aware of their thoughts and feelings as it is a healthy way for one to be control of themselves and the situation(s) that they may be in. It can be easy to get lost in the busyness of life and I think that that is the reality for most individuals, so learning how to take a step back and focus on what you are feeling, why you may be feeling that way, what your next steps are, etc. is just a mentally healthier approach to life. Rather than stressing and panicking over uncomfortable situations, by understanding what it means to be mindful, one might approach a situation in a way that is more rational, logical, and beneficial to that individual.\n\nThere are a number of benefits that come with meditation and the practice of mindfulness. It is said that these practices promote mental clarity, increased memory, improved abilities to problem solve, increased happiness, improved cognitive functions, improved immune function, etc. In short, practicing mindfulness not only contributes to psychological improvements, but cognitive and physical improvements as well. Stress is detrimental to your physical and mental health and can take a toll on other areas of your life, so rather than letting stress \"kill\" you, I believe everyone should be proactive in learning healthy coping mechanisms through meditation and mindfulness.\n\nTeaching mindfulness at a school is especially beneficial to it's students since school can be one of the most stressful and anxiety-inducing thing in one's life. Students can learn how to tackle negative emotions that sometimes come with school and those skills can translate into other areas of their life. Rather than continuing this unhealthy cycle of allowing people  to not know how to control their emotions or take control of the situations they are put in, we should help educate others as much as we can so that we can break those bad habits and promote healthier ones.\n\nMindfulness allows for clarity and I do believe that the best decisions are made when one is able to think clearly and concisely. Whether this is in a personal, professional, or academic setting, learning how to be present in the moment and be aware of what is going on around us and within us is an important life skill that can push you through some of the toughest of circumstances.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, mindfulness should be taught and practiced in schools. First and foremost, mindfulness can enhance students' well-being and mental health. The pressures and stresses of academic life can take a toll on young minds, leading to anxiety and other mental health issues. By introducing mindfulness practices, schools can provide students with valuable tools to manage their stress and improve their overall emotional well-being. Mindfulness techniques teach individuals to observe their thoughts and emotions without judgment, promoting self-awareness and the ability to respond to challenging situations in a calm and composed manner.\n\nMoreover, mindfulness can positively impact students' academic performance. By cultivating a sense of focus and concentration, mindfulness helps students improve their attention spans, which is crucial for learning and retaining information. When students are more present in the classroom, they can absorb knowledge more effectively and engage with the material at a deeper level. Additionally, mindfulness practices foster a positive learning environment by promoting empathy, compassion, and kindness among students, creating a supportive community conducive to learning and collaboration.\n\nCritics may argue that schools should prioritize academic subjects and that mindfulness is better suited for personal development outside of the classroom.

First, to list out what these effects are, I think they can largely be put into health effects, such as increased obesity and disrupted sleep schedules, and behavioral effects, such as difficulty paying attention and poor development of academic and social skills among children. \n\nLiving through the pandemic meant that so much more of our lives moved online. Recreation, social meetings, and work - have all increasingly transitioned to be virtual over the course of the last 2-3 years. This encourages us to have a sedentary lifestyle. While earlier you would take some time in between your day to walk to another building for a meeting, now you'd just hop on Zoom instead. We realized that we can wake up 10 minutes before a meeting which meant longer nights binge-watching shows disrupting our sleep patterns. Now that the pandemic is over, you'd think that some of this might transition back but this isn't happening. People are just continuing to work from home given that it is so much easier than before. We probably won't realize it now, but in a few years, we might all just be less active and healthy than before. \n\nAlso, kids stayed at home for longer and even took their classes online.

It's not a simple yes or no answer, like many things it's complex and we can both embrace the world of technology we live in while critiquing its shortcomings.\n\n    It's a privilege to be able to use a screen from home to work a job, to communicate with loved ones.  Otherwise have to travel or own a car, the money and time spent on those things can be allocated somewhere else. Having to find childcare, or spend that extra time in traffic or in a work environment that causes you stress because of issues of the past. You can choose to work from a cafe you love, a bed when you are sick, or from a different part of the globe altogether. This has opened up opportunities for collaboration across distances that we didn't have before. The ability to maintain relationships across the world. All these things cut down on costs, shorten the work day and increase connection.\n     \n   But with all these benefits we can expect there to be some new conflicts. Many people benefit from the community and social aspects of being in a school or office in person. It's no secret that staring at a screen for so many hours a day starts to mess with your eyes, your back from sitting slouched over so long, and your mental health. Being able to write a report for work from your home computer instead of one in an office is great, but not everything substitutes so easily. Watching a school lecture online alone discourages conversations between students and professors that would have led to stronger learning for example. Many students turn their attendance on and then fall back asleep in bed while their Zoom lecture plays as background noise. \n \n     Ultimately, we can't become disgruntled or angry that the technology we created and brought into our homes is damaging certain aspects of our lives. We are the creators and users and have the ultimate power to critique what we do with our screens and how we do it and make a change. If we can come to the understanding that having a screen in your back pocket that you can access so much of humanity's knowledge at any time of day is astounding; we will be headed in the correct direction. If we can learn and adapt to use digital devices to our greatest benefit while discarding them when they become harmful, we can enjoy the benefits that this digital age can offer.\n    ", "path": "./logs/pilot/557b3451b9004e24ae22bdd1542ca20f.jsonl", "prompt": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won.

{"essay": "\t\"It's like we're living in The Jetsons, right?\" A phrase and conversation that has become almost trite because of its high frequency in modern conversation. Humanity's most recent technological boom has given birth to jetpacks, automated kitchen appliances and practically usable artificial intelligence. Screen time is one of the most hotly debated topics, related to modern technology - primarily because it represents a large shift in the way we communicate as humans. Like the humble rotary telephone, the benefits of the enhancement of efficiency and creation of artistic possibilities are balanced by the risks of bad actors using the new tech. And just like most tools, the use of screens is neutral. We should embrace the value of our screens because they represent the natural progression of tool development.\n\tIt's too bad we don't have a running tally of the number of times adolescent humans have made a prank call using telephones vs. screens. If we did, we would be able to have some sort of quantitative way to compare good and bad uses of each form of communication. But we can assume that there was some sort of pushback to a perceived overuse of the rotary telephone. Parent/teacher associations of the time may have even extolled the dangers of skipping outside playtime to join a party line, or whatever rascally kids were doing at the time. The point I'm trying to make is that some social pushback to changes in communication technology will always happen. \n\tScreens are a technological marvel. The way humanity was able to develop the use of and explore benefits of screentime during the 2020 pandemic was astonishing. Global companies leveraged screentime to reduce the impact of slowed supply chains; entire school districts quickly migrated over to virtual learning; major governments pumped an unprecedented amount of money to develop screen technology for personal and professional use. \nAdvances in human technology should be explored, and that includes screen time. Although bad actors can use screen time to commit moral and legal crimes, screens are a useful and historically exciting way for humans to interact with each other. The creative and logistical opportunities are limitless, and humanity is arguably obligated to pursue this new form of communication. The rotary telephone revolutionized the world, and now, Jetson-esque technology is practically boring due to humanity's most recent technological boom. What's next - will we be communicating via teleportation soon?

{"essay": "We should certainly be worried to some degree about excessive reliance on and use of screens. Embracing the benefits of our digital devices is not incompatible with moderate use and conscientious consumption of screen technology. As an educator, I am particularly concerned with the prevalence of screens in the high school curriculum. In the classroom setting, screens disconnect students from one another and from teachers, disrupting the creative energy of the lesson and creating a wall between the teacher and audience. Laptops and phones in class are also extremely distracting\u2014I grew up in the first generation of students widely using laptops in middle and high school classes and can recall with perfect clarity the amount of time I could easily spend on non-lecture-related activities during class. In the present day, online courses have in some schools almost entirely supplanted manual teaching. Some high schools have gotten rid of libraries and physical books and started assigning all homework online. This takes a significant element of artistry and aestheticism out of the learning process, discourages presence, and begins to mess with children's physiology early on.\n\nThe excessive use of screen time has been linked to disordered sleep, depression, and other mental and physical challenges. Excessively reliance on technology has stunted brain development as we are no longer forced to engage in traditional problem-solving or even research as the era of AI unfolds. Learning how to manage technology effectively is incredibly important if we are to find a good balance between using it and losing it. \n\nFinally, we should be mindful of using technology as a replacement for social co-presence. The use of Zoom and virtual spaces in place of (e.g., where in-person contact would otherwise be feasible) in-person connection is creating a less interesting, less connected social scene. It's great to use video chat and other communication tools for convenience's sake and to connect with people from other places\u2014reducing all workplace functions to the computer, though, is deadening to the culture and the soul. In my time as a Federal law clerk, I saw many judges' eyes glaze over during virtual hearings purportedly deciding important legal rights\u2014saw the disconnect between the person behind the screen and their audience. Technology as a substitute for physical person-to-person interaction is not tenable. We should be regulating the use of tech in schools early on and encourage our young people to develop healthy and moderate relationships with technology while their brains are still growing, Then, as adults, these individuals will be well-positioned to balance virtual and real-world existence to the maximum benefit of their communities.      \n", "path": "./logs/pilot/dec5ddb9a7bb4ad49f64843cf2e77bfb.jsonl", "prompt": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, we should both be worried and not so worried about our use of screentime as a society. We have definitely ramped up our screentime since 2020 and the Covid pandemic, but we have also adapted as a society and found new ways to come together and address complex challenges. That being said, we should not allow screentime to fully replace the more connective, immersive forms of entertainment and social interaction. For younger children especially, it is extremely important to be active and have outlets that are not solely online or screen-based.\n\nI believe that as a society we should ultimately be focused on how our humanity interfaces with our digital technology. In other words, although we should embrace our current technology and not become luddites, we should also get creative about finding new ways to dynamize and socialize these technologies. We cannot allow screentime to be all-consuming, and we cannot let the digital world outstrip the person-to-person world of interaction and community. Indeed, a sense of physical community is something which many modern people are lacking. In America especially, there is often no strongly felt physical bond between a citizen and their neighbors, coworkers or fellow citizens. And although digital communities and social media have offered fresh alternatives to physically embedded community, these are certainly no replacement for this near necessity of human psychology. \n\nIn conclusion, although we shouldn't forsake screentime or shun its use, we should certainly be proactive and creative and its integration with our person-to-person, physically rooted communities around us. Ideally, screentime and digital community participation should be a supplement to the activities and challenges of the world around us.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, excessive screen time poses a significant threat to our collective well being. While seemingly benign, social media and messaging apps can appear to be a more efficient and free way to stay up to date on the news, keep in contact with friends or family, and even work from home. However, while do not pay for these apps in cash, we pay for them with our time. Platforms compete for our attention through a combination of notifications, specialized algorithms, and targeted advertisements designed to make us disengage from our real-world surroundings in favor of digital engagement.\n\nMany of us experience a surge of dopamine when we hear the pleasant \"ping\" of a new text message or instagram DM. However,  this brief moment of joy is soon lost upon the realization that that after responding to that notification, hours were spent absentmindedly scrolling through a twitter or instagram feed. The enticing design of many of these social media interfaces limits our personal autonomy to disengage from them. \n\nTo this end, some might wonder why does it matter if we are consumed by our screens? I would point to recent psychological studies that have found that excessive screen time is correlated with increased depression. Within the context of a global pandemic, in which depression and suicide rates have skyrocketed, we should explore efforts to help users mitigate screen time use as a  public health intervention.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, screen time was always an excessive amount of time. Covid really started in 2020 and it became more excessive now. I don't feel it should be anything to worry about due to the impressive ways to make income online, seeing family and friends that aren't local and doing schoolwork. These are just a few beneficial ways that screentime has come to. \n\tAs we know it's so much money to be made online. Affiliate marketing, posting reels, drop shipping, creating blogs, Amazon FBA, Amazon KDP and online courses. These are just a few, there's so much more out there. When the pandemic hit we relied on social media for online marketing to start our businesses and even promote our products we are selling! This is indeed a huge benefit whenever we are making money online! It also shoes that a lot of people didn't return to their job after the pandemic was over and continued making money online. Alot of people realized a 9-5 job is underpaid and they're underappreciative which drew more people to start ways on making money online. \n\tFamily and friends haven't always been close by and after the pandemic hit it became even harder. Sending videos and pictures and facetime is a huge plus. We can still see our loved ones from afar! It's like they are right there with us! This is a no brainer, especially if someone is sick we can still see them without getting sick. \n\tSchool work online should of been brought up before the pandemic. Seriously its very convenient for parents and children who have no transportation to go to school. Children are learning more how to be independent when learning from a laptop at home. It's obviously more self-discipline, which is a good skill to have.\n \nResponse2: \nIn my opinion, the amount of screentime usage is extremely excessive! We definitely need to be worried about the amount of screentime used. I mean think about it! We use the screen for everything almost! We use it to work, social media and for entertainment. \n\tUsing a screen for an excessive amount of time if obviously not good for you. We use it to work when we are on the computer 8 hours plus in a day staring a screen! Then to go to our phones to go on social media and watch reels all day then to watch movies on tv. I believe and know screen time increased insanely during and after the pandemic. Our kids are on tablets for school or for entertainment purposes. I believe going to physical school is more beneficial than virtual. it's too many distractions when in virtual school oppose to physical. \n  When it comes to entertainment using screen time, don't get me started! I've personally spent hours on a screen when I was supposed to be getting things done. It's the biggest distraction. We are giving children tablets to keep them busy when too much screen time. or some would say any, isn't good for us. \n\tI definitely think we should lower the amount of screen time when it comes to work, social media and entertainment.

{"essay": "In my opinion, the overuse of screen time for people of all ages is an issue that should be addressed. While technology has many valuable uses, it also has many dangers. Some of these dangers are overt, while others are not. I would suggest that the dangers that are not so obvious are actually the ones we should be worried about the most. \n\nIf we look at the statistics involving children and teenagers alone, the rates of cyberbullying, dangerous risk-taking, and suicide have exploded. In generations past, a school-yard bully needed to have the physical strength to back up his or her verbal taunts. That is no longer the case. Now, anyone with a phone and access to the internet can post anything they want from the safety of a keyboard, and an army of others, even strangers can join in with no barriers. Children, teens, and even adults play into this on social media platforms across the internet. The flip side of this is that people spend so much time glued to their screens that they spend their lives with no sense of community. Gone are the days when kids played outdoors together and spent time with their friends and families. Or that adults were close to their neighbors and spent time regularly with the people close to them. In this modern age of being closer to our technology than the people around us, when cyberbullying or any other trauma happens, who do the victims have to turn to? They don't have connections. They don't feel a sense of support or that they have anyone they can talk to that will understand. How can they? Everyone they know has their face buried in a screen as well. So, hurt and alone, they take drastic action. Leaving their mark on the headlines of the news as a suicide no one expected, or a mass shooting no one could have imagined, or something else equally devastating. \n\nWhat about a less severe issue? Posting everything about our lives for the entire world to see. Is it necessary? Is it honest? I would say  the answer is \"rarely.\" It does make staying connected to friends and family that are far away a bit easier. But, it also allows us to carefully curate the images and information people have about our lives. We only post the best photos. We spend so much time posing for the perfect shot so it looks candid. We Photoshop, we try different outfits, we tweak, we change everything. Why? What does it matter what millions of people who we do not know and will never meet think about our bodies and our personal lives? Why are we focused on the lives of perfect strangers instead of things like the educational system in our country, or the mental health crisis? Or the fact that the obsession with our screens and what appears on them is contributing TO the mental health crisis? \n\nTechnology and it's advancement are a good thing. But even good things need to be used in moderation. Overuse, even of something good, can lead to problems. Sometimes those problems are minute and easily resolved. Other times, those problems get bigger and harder to control as an entire society turns a blind eye and people of all ages pay the price. Even more sobering, the people paying the highest price, those people are our children. If we let this destroy the lives that are our future, what does that say about what we value most? \n\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/b974d89e374a4533b3db35d00fd0c53a.jsonl", "prompt": "How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the screen use issue, like most issues, has no hard answer. There are both positive and negative effects of screen use, and pretending that either in-person or screen only communication is perfect, is ridiculous. Specific sectors benefit more from screen use, while others need more in-person communication, but all sectors can benefit from both. \n\nSchooling is the perfect example of this. During the pandemic, schools for all ages went online only. And you have likely seen the headlines about lower literacy rates and students falling letter grades. However, these negative effects are seen more in younger populations. My freshmen year was disrupted my the pandemic and my education did not suffer. Not having to commute meant that I had more time for my classes, and I decided to take harder electives that I normally would not have had time for. \n\nOffice work also comes with mixed results from increased screen use. My dad found working from home to be a great experience. He had more free time, he could multitask during meetings, and he got more sleep. The company no longer had to rent an office space, or pay for cleaning services. And studies have shown that productivity generally increases when workers switch to online work. However, younger workers often having trouble developing the connections they need to further there career when working at home. Bosses are less attached to people they have not seen in person, and fire and hire more readily. \n\nIn summary, a hybrid model is the best way forward. Elementary schools should remain in-person, but the option to go online should be available for college students. Younger office workers might want to stay in the office, while older and more firmly established workers could stay at home. And other sectors have other happy mediums they can work towards.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the digital era is the undoing of men. In fact, many of the gen z generations are seen as vulnerable or co-dependent on their phones. As a teacher, I see how phone addiction has taken over the youth of the new generation. In my opinion, excessive screen use should be analyzed on how it influences brain development. While media and technology can provide proper scaffolds to younger children, I feel that if overused, excessive screen use at younger ages will be the undoing of their physiological and neurological capabilities. Another concern is the inability to pay attention to one subject for too long. In fact, excessive screen use can have effects on memory ability and learning; a recent study shows that the longer we are in front of one screen, the more inability the subject showed towards paying attention. Another reason would be the emotional capability that is declining in our youth. An example of this is the problematic anxiety that younger children exhibit. Studies show that students have an increase in anxiety from having their electronics taken away. Most of this is exhibited by anger or sadness.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology plays a large part in dating in today's world. As someone who has used dating apps in the past, it can be a very tricky process. I find that building a dating profile, selecting photos, and a few fun quotes - sometimes creates a separate and inauthentic persona. Dating apps rely heavily on looks and immediate first impressions of a person. There is no way one can distill their true essence down to a profile. Additionally, much of the time these profiles are nothing but a performance. It is a curation of a relationship before the relationship ever even starts. \n\nWith that said, the times that I have used a dating app, the process has been at best uneventful. It is very hard to truly convey one's wants in a relationship through an app. The process can feel very detached like, the person you're speaking to is not entirely real - instead just a collection of photos. For me, if I matched with someone we would get to know each other maybe, meet in person once or twice, and then the \"relationship\" would fizzle out. \n\nHowever, I do know people in long-term relationships that met on the Internet or through an app. We spend so much time online, curating platforms on social media, talking, texting, etc. That it is no surprise to me that these relationships do come naturally for some. My criticism is not to say that one can not find a successful relationship through an app or on social media but it is not my preferred way to get to know someone.  \n\nI do think the fact that we are so plugged into what the people around us, or even complete strangers, are doing hinders relationships. Social media and comparison go hand in hand. It is hard to not want to compare yourself or your relationship, to what another person presents their relationship to be. However, we know that much of the time what we post does not necessarily match reality 100% of the time. It is very easy to perceive faults in one's own relationship based on the highlight reel of someone else's. \n\nOverall, I think technology plays a bigger part in modern dating and relationships than we like to admit. It can be very hard to find a partner on a dating app and cultivate an authentic relationship based on a profile.

Even if the person represents themselves accurately, it is difficult to describe your personality accurately online. You don't really know if you are going to get along with the person you swiped on until you see them.\n\nIf you do find love online, maintaining the relationship can be difficult over text, e-mails, and video calls. Technology is an embedded part of our lives, and trying to work with it in a romantic relationship can cause some difficulties. For one thing, it is hard to recognize a person's tone of voice in a text, because there are no other cues like body language, inflection, and the actual tone of voice. Secondly, texting is a completely different, constantly changing language that is independent of Standard Written English. One person may send a text saying simply, \"Ok.\" meaning she accepts the suggestion to do something and is ready to jump in. However, the person seeing the text may read \"Ok.\" with a negative connotation, like \"fine,\" or \"whatever.\" This kind of confusion can strain an online relationship\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/71edb2b5018f4675b569b4cc3dd27491.jsonl", "prompt": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology can affect dating in just about every possible way! In fact, in all honesty, within the past decade, or so, technology has completely transformed the way we date. Nearly constantly I am seeing advertisements for offerings such as dating apps, new social media platforms, and even themed dating websites. The world of dating has become more accessible and convenient than ever before which of course makes it a whole different ballgame than it was back when people had to go to bars, clubs and restaurants to meet other people. \n\nTechnological advancements have opened up new avenues for people to meet and connect with each other, regardless of their location or personal circumstances. There are of course challenges that come along with technology too. For one, it has made dating much more superficial than it previously was, with many people basing their decisions solely on someone's profile picture or bio. The very long list of options can overwhelm people, making it harder for them to commit to one person and thus leading to more cheating and infidelity in relationships. The constant notifications and distractions from our phones can also make it difficult to fully engage in a date or develop a meaningful connection when you do go out on a date. \n\nifferent streaming apps also make a huge impact in the dating world, because it draws attention away from your date. For this reason, I\u2019ve never really been a fan of going to the movie theater and seeing a movie as a date because it distracts you from the person that you are supposed to be getting to know. Having a movie night as a date in the comfort of your own home often draws your attention even farther away from the person that you are supposed to be becoming familiar with, and can also lead to nefarious things such as \u201cNetflix and Chill\u201d which causes a whole host of problems in its own right.\n\nOverall, while technology has made dating more accessible and convenient, it has also brought its own set of challenges and obstacles that really challenge our previous understanding of the dating world.", "path": "./logs/pilot/e5d630bbfd12468e8ecf05a3a64d0063.jsonl", "prompt": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology has had a very strong effect on dating. The universal nature of modern technology has affected nearly every field of society, even dating, and the advent of services for dating such as apps and websites have led to a new \"form\" of dating. I have had a decent amount of experience with dating apps, and I think that they have definitely changed the way younger generations view dating. I am a part of that younger generation, so I have grown into adulthood with dating apps and services being a staple of dating, not a novelty. Dating apps and services are not the only technological innovation that has changed the dating landscape though, social media and texting have also had a drastic impact on how people view dating.\n\nSocial media, in my opinion, has added to the increased objectification of the human body, and although I am fully in support of people expressing themselves and their bodies in any way, I think it has had the added effect of creating an unachievable ideal for the human body, and for potential dating partners. Although, social media has had some benefits too, like allowing for increased levels of interaction between friends or partners in a way that was simply inconceivable just 20 years ago. Texting, like social media, has created an atmosphere of \"connectivity\", where people, and especially dating partners, can be connected to one another across far distances.\n\nFrom my experience, dating apps are equal parts good and bad. Everyone wants something different from a relationship, from its length or their partner, so I think dating apps have helped people find a relationship that better aligns with what they're looking for. However, many dating apps end up hosting a combination of society's unreachable ideals, and people simply view a profile picture and determine whether they are attractive or not, without giving much \"humanization\" to the person behind it. I think everyone is guilty of that, and it is incredibly hard to avoid due to the nature of dating apps. Some dating apps have tried to negate this, but ultimately I think dating apps and technology related to dating are a reflection of society's evolution", "path": "./logs/pilot/8237e5f56dbd4716a076e7b25a5ac946.jsonl", "prompt": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating?

First and foremost your intention for what you are wanting to get out of your dating ecperience should be set before choosing the technology you will utilize. Questions like; \"Am I looking for a long-term relationship, or marriage, or am I looking to have a good time?\", and other questions should be addressed. \n\nMost people in my experience will certainly go to '\"the apps\".  In my experience I have used the apps and found there are many options to choose from. I have seen a wide array of results on \"the apps\" and it is important to note that I had to realize that my ontent needed to be very clear in my basic profile in order to see more success in the dating scene. I am very grateful and feel lucky to have found the person I am married to on an app. However if I had not been clear about my expectations I doubt I would have seen favorable results.\n\nThe use of technology in dating and relationships is a piece that needs to be navigated by all parties involved. It is helpful to have clear expectations about how, when and what technologies will be utlized in the dating process. This will provide more opportunity for clear communication, and the potential development of friendship and potentially romantic relationships.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, dating without technology is virtually impossible these days. Even so, there are both positives and negatives to dating with the help of technology. Technology makes the dating pool a lot deeper than it used to be. For instance, I live in a small town. If I dated only single people in my town, I would not have many dating options. When I use dating apps, I can meet singles from nearby cities. I am not limited to first encounters that happen in real time. \n\nOne drawback to dating apps is that people are sometimes not their real selves. In the most extreme circumstances, companies use bots to boost their image. Sometimes real people use fake profiles, and sometimes people just lie. It is very difficult to tell online or on an app if a person is being genuine. This makes it challenging, not to mention a waste of time, to determine if a possible connection is legitimate. \n\nTechnology also impacts communication during dating. If by some chance two single people meet and hit it off, they are likely to communicate heavily through the use of technology, whether it's texting, Facetime, or some other app. Technology gives couples the ability to communicate more frequently, but sometimes those interactions lack depth. People who depend on texting rather than talking face-to-face or even talking on the phone are likely to have superficial conversations rather than meaningful ones.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology has made dating both easier and more difficult. When I dated in my teens and twenties, technology was not a factor. The only way to meet new people was in person. Occasionally, a friend or family member might introduce me to someone. Now as a divorced woman in my forties, it is almost impossible to date without using technology. I have found technology to be a necessary evil when it comes to dating. \n\nOn one hand, technology such as dating apps makes it easier to meet interesting people. This is especially true because I live in a small town where meeting single adults is very difficult. Dating apps have allowed me to \"meet\" other single adults who I might not meet without the help of the apps. Technology such as texting and chatting on apps makes communication easier, especially when getting to know someone new. Most busy adults don't have the time or energy for a lot of talking on the phone. Texting is a quick way to find out if I want to meet someone in person. \n\nOn the other hand, there are many downsides to technology and dating. One major concern with dating apps is that there are fake profiles mixed in with the real ones. Some apps create fake profiles to boost their numbers, and some people create fake profiles or lie in their profiles for a number of other reasons. There are cheaters who create dating profiles for twisted reasons, and there are people who lie to make themselves more appealing. The world of dating apps is a treacherous one. The same is true of technology such as social media and texting. It is difficult to get to know the real person hidden behind the technology, and there's always the risk of wasting time with someone who isn't honest.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology has had a mixed effect on the dating scene. Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble have allowed people to meet a wide variety of people they may have never met otherwise. People can meet one another worldwide and form real and genuine connections. On the other hand, online dating has prompted new scenarios and problems that weren't a problem in the real world. There is the problem of catfishing, where someone can easily disguise their identity from the person they are talking to online. Like all things in life, there are plenty of positives and negatives to the online dating scene.\n\nI have used dating apps in the past, specifically Tinder. I met my current girlfriend, whom I have had for over a year, through Tinder. I can say that meeting people through online dating apps, at least through Tinder, was very difficult. Striking that first conversation with someone and forging that connection took a lot of work online. However, I am forever grateful for online dating because there is no way I would have ever met my girlfriend without its existence.\n\nOnline dating has highlighted the importance of face-to-face interaction when forging emotional and solid connections. The best relationships I have seen others build from online dating have always moved quickly to meet in person, via Facetime, or some other video chat. We, as humans, communicate a lot through our physical interactions\u2014facial expressions, joking in public, and even cuddling show that words sometimes have difficulty describing.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology is both beneficial and harmful to dating. I believe that technology like dating apps and social media can help a  relationship by helping two people find each other when they wouldn't have otherwise. On the other hand, the increase of social media use also causes distrust in a relationship. Additionally, technology can also potentially cause a distraction in a relationship, leading to less meaningful bonds. Ultimately I believe that, while technology can be useful when bringing two people together, it can be harmful in the long run because of distrust and distractions. \n\nIf it weren't for dating apps, many people would not be together today. I used dating apps in the past, and from it I met my ex-boyfriend who I dated for 5 years. My best friend also used dating apps to find a boyfriend, and they have been together for over 7 years. Before dating apps, many people would have never thought to talk to the person they are dating now. Be it because they wouldn't have crossed paths or wouldn't have known they have anything in common, dating apps play an important role in new relationships. \n\nAlthough technology can benefit a relationship when two people are first meeting, it can be harmful in the long run due to distrust caused by social media. Apps like Twitter and Instagram create a lot of opportunities for a partner to look at other and fantasize. With features like private and direct messages, a person could easily cheat on their significant other without them knowing. Even if they do not, there is always the lingering possibility that it might happen, which causes distrust. Ultimately, technology can be harmful because it can cause a riff between two people. \n\nTechnology can also be harmful to a relationship because it creates a distraction between two people. Although applications like Netflix and Hulu can create a fun activity to do together, it can also decrease the amount of genuine conversation being had. When two people are simply scrolling through TikTok or Facebook, they are not talking to each other or bonding. These are all ways that technology can harm a relationship. \nIn my viewpoint, technology possesses a dual nature when it comes to dating, carrying both advantages and drawbacks. I acknowledge that platforms such as dating apps and social media can be beneficial, as they facilitate connections between individuals who may not have crossed paths otherwise. Such technology can enable people to discover potential partners with greater ease and convenience. However, it is important to recognize that the increased use of social media can also introduce elements of distrust within a relationship. The presence of online interactions and exposure to various profiles may give rise to feelings of insecurity and suspicion. Furthermore, technology has the potential to create distractions within a relationship, diverting attention away from building meaningful bonds and fostering genuine connections. Considering these factors, I lean towards the belief that while technology can serve as a useful tool in bringing people together, it may have detrimental effects in the long run due to the emergence of distrust and the potential for distractions.\n\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/11c53e32e69848b8841fd4c517f83046.jsonl", "prompt": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the advent of online dating has increased the choosiness of partners seeking partners. With dating apps, for example, the number of choices have dramatically increased. With that, a person is prone to feel that they have more options. With more options, they tend to choose the best out of the bunch. The practice of doing so on a large scale refines and sharpens a person's preferences and decreases the possibility of \"settling\" for something average. \n\nIncreasing the number of competitors tends to increase the level of competition in any sport. For example, a local sports team would not compete well against a nationally organized sports team. This is simple due to probability. With a larger pool from which to take a sample, there is greater variability. With greater variability, there are more chances for an athlete to be better or worse. This is why competitive levels tend to increase from amateur to professional sports to the Olympics. As a result, the competitiveness in an online dating market is higher. \n\nOnline dating may also increase the frequency of dating. Depending upon a person's disposition, they may choose to date more as the number of persons that they can date has also increased. This may allow a person to explore preferences and different types of people. Such exploration may lead to more satisfaction in future dating life. With that, though, there is the tendency to also wonder if the grass is greener on the other side. They may fall victim to the fear that they settled too quickly, and a better partner may be found with just a few clicks away. That temptation is certainly bound to influence the dynamics of dating, and its effects will depend on the person's character. \n\nIn conclusion, online dating increases the frequency of dating by increasing the number of options that are typically available to in-person dating. This can lead to increasing the choosiness of seekin a partner, and it can also increase life satisfaction through exploration of preferences.

To me, first and foremost, it's annoying. However, as a person who is not a big social media person, I still have a Facebook account and Instagram. The former was established years ago when the main idea was to connect people. The latter, I set it up because my kids pretty much insist on using the Instagram platform for texting. Alas, if I want to reach them, I need to use that platform if I am going to increase the odds that they will see and respond to anything I might want to tell them. Granted, I am older and come from a time of pre-social media, so I more or less have not kept up with the myriad social media platforms out there. However, all of that said, I have to admit that once familiarized with the Instagram platform, I, of course, wound up scrolling just like seemingly everyone else. But what I see on this platform, generally speaking, is appalling.  \n\nThe social media feeds are polluted with beautiful women and men, as mentioned above, in beautiful places, which on the surface, might be appealing. I certainly would not complain about some of the aesthetics I have seen. But, and it's a big but... all of this creates a false perception of these scantily clad folks making their duck faces for the camera (most of the time selfie style), acting cute and projecting confidence, great bodies, and a jet-set lifestyle. \n\nI am certain that not all of those lives are so perfect. And again, I admit I have caught myself mindlessly scrolling, looking at memes and all kinds of wild and crazy things all of these influencers are up to. It's addicting, but for me it's more a muscle memory and occasional boredom. I move on to something more productive, and that's the end of it. The problem is, and this is why it makes me cringe, there are arguably millions of young adults out there who think that is how they are supposed to look or that is what success looks like. The reality is it can be, and maybe even should be, something else entirely. But these influencers are doing more harm than good, in my opinion. Evidently, I am not the only one, I can't remember which social media platform it was (perhaps multiple), but class action lawsuits against these companies who allow this kind of sensationalism to propagate, making and presumably laughing all the way to the bank while teenage girls starve themselves to look like some influencer they idolize on social media.\n\nTo me, these platforms and influencers are nothing more than mild low-brow entertainment, but so many impressionable people out there just can't enough of that duck-faced girl looking at herself like a female Narcissus or some muscle-bound maniac jumping out of a plane with his dog.

{"essay": "\nI don't usually consume a lot of media that relies heavily on stereotypes, but subtle stereotyping is hard to avoid altogether. The portrayal of immigrants in TV is one area where stereotypes abound and are difficult to stomach. Fez from That 70s Show, for example, is an interesting case given that the show never explicitly clarifies what country he comes from, but rather types him as a generic \"foreigner.\" Fez's name, even, is not revealed\u2014the nickname is just an acronym for \"foreign exchange student\" (with a \"z?\"). The effect is to have a brown guy with a funny accent that many will feel comfortable laughing at without accompanying feelings of guilt at the racism\u2014his portrayal is not stereotypical of any specific, real racial group. In my mind, though, this exacerbates the harm as it seems to reduce all non-white and/or immigrant peoples into the same, unserious, unintelligent, overly-sexual yet asexualized stock figure. \n\nThere are also the many many women in \"classic\" 20th-century literature written by white men whose place in these novels is only as erotic fodder or a projector screen on which the white male protagonists can experience life, character development, and heroic arcs. The flattening of female characters in books has gotten so extreme as to give rise to modern terms like \"Mary Sue\" and \"manic pixie dream girl,\" who are as interchangeable as they are dull. The stereotyping of women in novels like Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, Atlas Shrugged, On the Road, and so, so many more doesn't particularly bother me\u2014rather, poorly-written women is merely one bad feature of bad novels, whose utter failure to contribute anything interesting (aside from the beautiful prose in Fitzgerald's case) to my life extends well beyond the stereotyping. \n\nWhether or not I would refuse to read or watch a given work due to offensive portrayals depends on the overarching quality of the piece and the offensiveness and feeling quality of the stereotype. The Merchant of Venice, for example, contains a multitude of offensive stereotypes of Jewish people but is itself a brilliant work of social commentary that engages with the complexities of the anti-semitism it portrays. I have yet to have an experience of watching or reading something otherwise redeemable that nevertheless has offensive stereotypes not serving a broader purpose connected to critiquing the stereotypes.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are good ways and bad ways to write a stereotypical character. When done correctly, I would say that the cringe factor of a given character is considerably lessened. When it comes down to it, there are probably a given number of ways in which a person can act as a human being. It makes sense, then, that a lot of the time, characters in media are often written as behaving in one of those stereotypical ways. \n\nThat said, I think this is what separates good writing from bad, or at least mediocre, writing. Even if we take it as a given that human beings act in a defined set of different ways, that doesn't mean that the portrayal of these characters has to be so stereotypical. For example, if a character is clearly the \"bully\" in a given book, movie, or television show, I think everyone can agree that this character is going to act in a certain way. Where writers can differ, however, is (1) in how they portray the actual bullying done by the character, and (2) how the writer chooses to develop the backstory, or motivation, for that character's actions. \n\nWhile the first is a bit difficult to articulate, the most frank way would be to say that a writer might write an interesting bully. For example, a stereotypical bully character might go around the schoolyard and push smaller kids down to the pavement. We've all seen it. But that isn't interesting. Another writer might portray a bully refraining from any physical violence, but engaging in teasing or other mental games. And yet another writer might combine the two, engaging in some super elaborate scheme to turn another child's friends against them, before finally setting up some situation that would injure the target physically. Some of those scenarios are obviously more interesting than the others, and I think that is where the \"cringe\" aspect can come in. If a writer is only able to portray the first type of \"bully,\" the result will be boring and cringeworthy. If they are able to portray the latter, it's more interesting, and might make for a more complex character. \n\nAs far as the final question, I'm certainly not above refusing to watch or read something because of an offensive portrayal, but the bar is pretty high, and would more likely have something to do with the author, rather than the character itself. If the point was to create an offensive character, for example, I'd have no trouble reading that (assuming its written well), as opposed to a character being written in an offensive manner due to the viewpoints of the author themselves", "path": "./logs/pilot/9e1dcc96189441a6b3235f44bcf28774.jsonl", "prompt": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why?

{"essay": "\n\tIn my opinion, stereotypical media characters can be beneficial depending on the source material. Most of the time, stereotypical characters serve in media as a foil to a well-established character, usually the protagonist. Stereotypical characters; however, by themselves with no given depth or foil is a bad addition to any plot. \n\tThe reason that stereotypical characters are bad is that oftentimes these characters serve a very one-dimensional portion within a text, movie, or show. Most of the time these characters serve in a child-like show nature, like a Barbie movie. Often, these stereotypical characters are presented to be plain figures in a story. Usually, these characters are the antagonist, serving only one purpose in the story. Personally, characters that are cringy are characters that are used by a weak author in an attempt to mend their story together. This being said, that is to not say that all stereotypical characters are bad. For example, the dumb dad is a humorous joke made in a lot of Western media. \n\tThe difference between a good and bad stereotypical character would be how the character is used within the story.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, this is not the best question for me to answer but I'll try. You see, I don't much care for pop culture, and while I do enjoy movies and TV shows, I don't think deeply about either beyond what I'll find entertaining. With books, I'm a little more circumspect and only read things that I will enjoy and/or find useful. \n\nWhen first looking at this question, the fool or idiot came to mind \u2013 the comic relief. Specifically, Jar Jar Binks from the prequel Star Wars trilogy. Nevermind the fact that George Lucas is terrible at character development and dialogue, and pretty much everyone was bad in those movies, especially given the talent, but Binks was unbearable to watch. Even today, I find it hard to watch those movies because of his scenes. And while \"Revenge of the Sith\" isn't leaps and bounds better, it's made exponentially better by the fact that Binks has a much reduced role in the movie (the novelized version is so so much better!). \n\nMoving on but still sticking with the screen, the next group of cringe characters are child actors who can't act. Here again, I'm thinking of young kid who played Anakin Skywalker and how goofy and 'after school special-like\" his acting and scenes were. However, I level no criticism at the child (now an adult) who played the young dark lord of the sith because he was a kid taking direction from the director. It's not his fault his acting was bad. It's not any one of those actors's faults that they weren't great in the movies \u2013 they were trying to bring Lucas' vision to life and they can only work with what they were given. \n\nMoving beyond Star Wars, these days I look often look back on comedies we watched back in the early aughts, the 90s, 80s, and before and look at the type of characters in those movies. \n\nTake Bill Murray's portrayal of Dr. Peter Venkman in \"Ghostbusters.\" Boys and young men loved him. He was funny, charming, witty, and a bully to perceived bad guys, but nowadays we look at his character (and the man in real life) with more skepticism and cringe. We liked him because he was a prick. We thought his womanizing and his torture of college students who annoyed him as light-hearted fun. His pursuit of Dana Barrett was perceived as righteous when in reality it crossed a line of stalking and sexual harassment. In reality, he was toxic and probably not that fun to be around.\n\nBut movies and TV shows from that era up through the late aughts are rife with these lovable rogues who are actually toxic, if not completely terrible. The \"American Pie\" series is full of this bad, sexually predatory behavior from characters we were supposed to see as lovable idiots, harmless jocks, or even heroes. At least, there was an undercurrent of less toxic themes in those movies!\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/cd2bd53c5a79444d97bbb1711fd8a497.jsonl", "prompt": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why?

{"essay": "\nAs a child, I loved The Aristocats. It was among a suite of countless Disney films I could watch over and over. I work at a middle school, so my students often want to listen to Disney songs in the background while they work or play sing-along videos on the projector during free time. One day, after the kids had left, I saw that Youtube had suggested the Aristocats \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\" -  a longtime favorite of mine that I had not revisited in many many years. I played it and was pleasantly surprised to see the animation still remained fluid, exciting, and engaging. The music was excellent, the voice acting superb, and it remained a fun watch... until its interlude. Abruptly, the song breaks into a simple boogie-woogie piano rhythm with vocals. And the vocals and visuals immediately sink into abject stereotyping and misery. A \"Siamese\" cat with stereotypically Eastern Asian features that could be taken right out of a propaganda poster from the late 19th century begins playing the piano with chopsticks and sprechstimming with a grossly-exaggerated Asian drawl: \"Hong Kong, Shanghai, Egg Foo Young, Fortune Cookie Always Wrong\". Kids and adults alike are blasted by the voice actor of Tigger's grotesque parody of Asian harmonies, accents, and images.\n\nI'm not convinced I could sit down and enjoy watching Aristocats with my own kids in the way my parents did with me. And this is no isolated incident - Disney films are riddled with this kind of relentless stereotyping and appealing to the lowest common denominator of hurtful humor of its time. Without question, offensive portrayals in movies, music, television and books make it difficult and sometimes impossible to watch or enjoy things I once found enjoyable.\n\nDepictions from years past are by no means the only instances of stereotypical depictions that ruin an otherwise enjoyable show. Modern shows, books, and music have their fair share of offensive and tasteless depictions as well. Oftentimes, modern stereotypes hide behind layers of irony and make it difficult to ascertain whether a depiction is offensive at the expense of its subject, or whether it is slyly poking fun at outmoded stereotypes. These layers of irony are illustrated in work ranging from \"The Boondocks\" to \"Tropic Thunder\". Kendrick Lamar often plays with explorations of stereotypes, racism, and racial tropes as well.\n\nIn most cases, stereotypical depictions of characters and people will make something unwatchable or unreadable for me. With historical context, a great work is merely complicated by its depictions that were of its time, but for low and middle-brow works, they are almost always sullied by the prejudices of their time. While Huckleberry Finn is a far cry from the worst and lowest works of racist humor and anger of its time, with modern eyes, it grows increasingly difficult to accept any needless stereotyping and offensive portrayals in media.", "path": "./logs/pilot/4c2a773a85ff48fc971da31a406a46d9.jsonl", "prompt": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are many stereotypical characters in media that can turn me completely off the work. But, as I am a woman, I am going to focus on sexist stereotypes, as it's what I most notice.  \n\nSome level of sexism is not acceptable, but watchable for me, depending on the context of the media. For example, the treatment of women in Star Trek the Original Series. Uhura being scared in most situations is distressing, but since the show was trying and was progressive for the time period, I can still enjoy the show. However, I cannot tolerant that level of sexism in newer media. I could not get though watching the first Suicide Squad  treat Margot Robbie like a sex object instead of the crazy, badass, and terrifying Harley Quinn. \n\nSometimes, sexism can be well-intentioned.

They can be obvious, like Uhura being frightened, or less so, like women just never being more than a third of the cast, or the female characters rarely being in combat roles.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the archetype of the socially inept genius or nerd makes me cringe. Although the media portrayal and the cultural reception of nerds and super intelligent people have changed for the better in the last few decades, there still exists a lingering archetype. However, I don't think that this lingering archetype is offensive enough to warrant me not watching or shying away from certain films; it's more of a harmless gaffe, and not something truly offensive.\n\nAlthough there are some shows in which a socially inept genius is explicitly written into the story for comedic or thematic effect (as in \"The Big Bang Theory\"), many films unintentionally depict highly intelligent people as simultaneously socially inept or cripplingly awkward. Even films which are adaptations of true stories featuring real-life geniuses, such as \"A Beautiful Mind\" and \"Hawking\", tend to go overboard on the degree of social ineptitude of their main characters. Oftentimes, this is enough to be nearly comedic and downright theatrically embarrassing. \n\nIn conclusion, the socially inept nerd archetype is no doubt cringeworthy. And although it doesn't dominate media portrayals like it used to, it still makes an appearance from time to time, especially in films centered on genius-tier main characters.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, fundamentally it is not incorrect to focus on the welfare of other species instead of humans. We as the human species are just one part of this giant tapestry of life so caring for other living individuals is never \"incorrect\". However the nuance in the prompt arises from the choice to prioritize the alleviation of animal suffering over human suffering. It also frames this almost as a version of the trolley problem where, when asked to necessarily choose between the suffering of their own pet vs an unknown human, a decent chunk of respondents would save their own pet. This further confounds the question as the respondent is made to pick between their pet, an animal they have a relationship with, and a complete stranger. In this situation I believe it is completely valid to prioritize your own pet. \n\nThe general observation that people might be more empathetic towards animals than people could come from a perceived innocence or helplessness that we afford animals that we are not able to extend to fellow humans. \"They are just like me, why can't they protect themselves\", one might think of other humans. This is correct in one sense as we live in a human-dominated world and we as humans are more aware of the 'rules' of living in this society whereas however much they are trained, an animal is inherently not able to understand all of these rules so if it is punished for not adhering to the constructs, we define, we feel some measure of protectiveness. \n\nThat all being said, I do see the other side of this issue where a number of people are over-protective of their pets and would not even stand to hear a word against them. This is detrimental to this argument. If a dog bites a child, and the dog owner does not hear a word against it despite not leashing it, then the pet owner is at fault. But the difference here is that my anger is still more toward the owner than the pet because it feels strange to penalize a dog. This is again an instance of the perception of animals as one needing care. \n\nOf course, there are many people suffering in the world. I do not deny this. But in my limited sphere, I cannot be responsible for all of them. We try to do good in our limited sphere of influence and if I choose to prioritize animals over humans, that's completely valid.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I think we should focus more on human suffering because we are more useful than animals will ever be. If we care so much about animals in the first place, why are we letting so much of their habitats break down and diminish and we don't do anything about it. If you truly care about animals, you should start doing it in the first place. We can see example of this all over the world! For example, we have animal populations that are decreasing in Indonesia because we are replacing their habitats for palm trees. We may want to stop this, but this will simply take a long time. Palm oil is found in most of our everyday products, such as soap, candy, and most other foods. But on the other hand, humans are far more valuable as we hold more of a connection with them than stray animals.\n\nImagine if this was a scenario between one of your siblings and your pet dog. Which one will most likely be picked to save? Your siblings will most likely be picked as you have had way more experience with them from birth and you hold that stronger emotional connection with them. The pet on the other hand may had been adopted to recently and you may not have been able to get used to it yet. Pets may seem like family to you, but you know they aren't permanent, and they may not stay with you your whole life. That's another reason why some will probably pick siblings over their pets, as they will stay with them much longer and you will also still have that emotional and regular connection with them almost every day.\n\nWell, then let's talk about a scenario between a stray dog and a stranger, where you also must only save one of them. In both of these scenarios, you will not know either one of them, but depending on your personality, this will be a much more diverse probability of choosing one over the other. If one is empathetic and is caring, they will most likely choose the stray dog as they might feel a sense of innocence. But on the other hand, the person may talk, and they can start building that emotional connection in which you will most probably choose to save the stranger.\n\nPeople may feel more empathetic towards animals because they feel a sense of innocence about them as we may not understand them as well as we understand humans. This will be especially strong towards those who seem to be more empathetic and over the top caring towards people or animals. They will feel that strong emotion that the animal is more innocent than the human, so they must care more for it. But in reality, as we can see around the world, most of us don't take action and we leave our actions take place. If we don't understand most of their feelings and their personality inside, we are automatically to feel innocence around them.

What about during thanksgiving when everyone is waiting for the roast? That\u2019s some animal that must have been killed cruelly. Everyone is in the mood and they want to have a large chunk of the roast.\u00a0\n\nAway from that, animal protection is an act of kindness and the same must apply to humans. Animals are going into extinction but someone can lose their life too. Both kindness can co-exist. Saving an animal\u2019s life is not more important than saving that of a fellow human being.\u00a0\n\nYou cannot take away the fact that people like what they like; they have a soft spot for their pet and that\u2019s the reason the study would record up to 40 percent. However, if the study involved people\u2019s immediate family and their pet, everyone would agree that pet will take a little percentage. So, it seems the issue here is fondness first of all and not an animal to human comparison.\u00a0\n\nAlso, being kind to strangers has been a big issue all across the world. Even when people do not have to choose between their pet and a stranger, people hardly help a stranger. In the same vein, there have been more reports of racism and xenophobia among young people than previous generations. All these beckons for more kindness towards one another.\u00a0\n\nAnimal love is good. Human or stranger love is adorable. We can do better to be considerate towards ourselves. A little act of kindness keeps the world rolling and a safe place for the next generation to be. Like Michael Jackson said, \u201cThere is a place in your heart and I know it\u2019s love.\u201d\n\nBe kind to all.\u00a0 \n\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/c382a30f9d2943cdb9e0074bbb4879af.jsonl", "prompt": "Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, people are more empathetic toward the suffering of an animal rather than the suffering of a human because they feel that animals are inherently innocent. Many people view animals of all kinds as wholly good creatures who only do bad things in reaction to human actions. I think it is easier to empathize with an animal because one can project any feeling onto them and have it be true. Animals can not tell us what they are truly thinking or feeling, therefore it is up to us to fill in the gaps. This is where the disconnect becomes dangerous because we are humanizing beings that are not human. \n\nFor these reasons, I am not surprised that 40 percent of people would save their dog over a foreign tourist. Many people project and connect to their pets in very deep ways because these animals are not able to speak for themselves. People are much more complicated and although choosing a human life over an animal's may be more beneficial, morally - many people can not see through these feelings. \n\nWith that said, I do not think it is wrong to focus on the overall welfare of animals while there is human suffering. The alleviation of all suffering is the goal and to me, that includes animals. If one would like to dedicate their time and resources to saving animals I think that is a noble cause. It is when helping that animal causes direct harm to a human, as described in the research, that I feel is wrong.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, empathy is not exclusive to either animals or humans. People can feel varying degrees of empathy based on the situation. In the research example given, respondents may have felt more empathy toward the dog because they considered the animal to be defenseless. They may have responded differently if the human was a child or an elderly person. The respondents may have also been influenced by the details provided to them. It is not wrong or inhumane to focus on animal welfare when there are humans who are suffering. \n\nHuman suffering and animal suffering are both tragic realities of our world. Some people feel more compelled to fight for animal rights, and other people feel more compelled to fight for human rights. It would be shortsighted to criticize anyone who is doing their part to improve the circumstances of animals or humans when there are others who do nothing.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, it is absolutely not wrong (under many circumstances) for people to focus on animal welfare when there are humans out there who are also suffering. As a general rule animals are completely helpless beings, and they cannot do much of anything to help to save or protect themselves in a time of crisis like humans can often do. Additionally, animals are not corrupt and they don\u2019t wish harm upon other living beings unless it\u2019s part of their natural instincts, much unlike humans in today\u2019s society. \n\nIt seems to be that people are far more empathetic towards animals in any given situation. The reason for this is partially unknown, but is contributed to by the factors listed above among many other things. There\u2019s tons of media in today\u2019s society (television, movies and even books) in which people will go significantly out of their way to protect an animal while putting themselves or other humans in danger. I\u2019d personally like to think that it\u2019s due to human nature and instinct being to protect the innocent and most vulnerable although that could be only part of the reason this phenomenon happens.\n\nI have also seen through my own experiences that when animals (whether they be dogs, cats, horses etc.) pass away or are harmed in the various media that society consumes, the audience is almost immediately emotionally affected by the event. Let\u2019s take John Wick for example, in the first film viewers witnessed a very unfortunate attack on the titular character\u2019s pet and that is the event that many viewers remember above any other thing that happens in the movie.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I would not be surprised with the findings showing that people were more upset when cruelty was directed to a dog compared to a similar action on a human. Among the key reasons is that although humans are rational beings they have the capacity to inflict harm to both animals and amongst themselves. Therefore, I believe that people know that dogs are usually defenseless when attacked by human beings and as a result most people will empathize with harm directed towards animals compared to when directed to humans. \nAnother reason that people  empathize with animals is because there are no groups or communities that can share the suffering of animals compared to the number of groups that advocate against human suffering. Such occurrences indicate that when people see animals suffering they become concerned because of the lack of a voice. There is an assumption that animals need to be protected because the animals themselves cannot do so in their own capacity.\nAnimals have also demonstrated more loyalty to their owners compared to humans. As a result, I am not surprised that 40 percent of the respondents would save their pet instead of a foreign tourist. Human beings have the ability to manipulate and deceive, which is not the case when it comes to pet animals. Such negative and known attributes about human behavior can contribute to the empathy directed towards animals such as dogs compared to humans.  Such factors whereby humans have known the behaviors of humans amongst themselves and towards animals influence the way people consider the two. \nIn my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because similar to humans animals also need to be taken care of. Therefore, humans are not superior to animals because there is a mutual relationship that contributes to the existence of animals. For instance, dogs have been known to human companions for centuries and have contributed in hunting, security and even helping the disabled. Such contributions by animals show how humans are required to consider the welfare of animals. However, at time it can be ironical because some animals such as chicken and cows are consumed as food. In such instances, focusing on the welfare of the animals is confusing considering they will be slaughtered on the end. In sum, the relationship between humans-humans and animals-humans is the reason that more people are more empathetic with animals that they are towards their fellow humans.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, animals are nonhuman creatures with unique sensory organs and structures that deserve moral consideration because they experience suffering just like humans. Unlike humans, animals cannot resort to self-help or openly express themselves when suffering from terrible conditions like hunger, disease, or predation, among many others. Moreover, animals often have to deal with terrible situations caused by humans, particularly with the growing impact of climate change on their habitual environment. There is nothing wrong with offering donations to support animal welfare because animals deserve empathy and moral consideration too.\n\nThere is no doubt that humans are suffering, but that does not stop the world from focusing on animal welfare as well, because animals deserve freedom, comfort, and proper care. So, I would not say that people are more empathetic towards animals than humans because they are contributing to animal welfare or showing empathy. In fact, helping humans should not be done at the expense of providing animals with all the care and support they need. From providing easy access to fresh water, healthcare, a proper living environment, access to quality treatment, and adequate facilities to the prevention of mental suffering, animals deserve every kindness they can get.\n\nFurthermore, animal welfare has not been taken seriously as far as animal protection is concerned because many animals are suffering a great deal. It is unjustifiable to assume that animals are worth less moral consideration because they are not humans. While everyone is focused on creating a better world free from injustice and suffering, animals should not be removed from the picture because they also have emotions and can feel pain.\n\nOverall, there is nothing wrong with focusing on animal welfare when humans are suffering, because the truth is that animals are suffering too. However, unlike humans, much attention is not given to the cruelty animals are suffering from and how human activities are affecting the welfare and survival of both wild and domestic animals. To top it all, animals are considered vulnerable and weak like babies, which explains why people show much empathy when they are subjected to suffering, especially when it is perpetrated by humans.

{"essay": "\nThis is a topic I feel rather strongly about. To be glib, I remember having a related discussion with a friend in late high school - the friend summed up my consideration of the argument as follows: \"I guess when something bad happens to a human, it's just easier to imagine they deserved it\". It's this blamelessness and innocence of animals that drives our empathic response to their suffering to be more immediately visceral than when we think of the suffering of our own kind.\n\nI believe this response is twofold, and I do not believe it to be wrong to focus on animal welfare or respond more dramatically to animal suffering than to injustices perpetrated against humans. One element of this response is a naturally nurturing element of the care animals require. To imagine a dog being needlessly hurt by humans implies a power dynamic that most people are deeply uncomfortable with. A dog lacks the ability to reason or reliably argue with the human, and because of the owner/pet dialectic, it is expected that the human has the dog's best interest in mind. In the above research study, there is also a complication of terms and prompts. Would a human most likely save their own child over a child of a foreign tourist? What of a local? Human beings are wired to care for their charges, and socially we have changed over the thousands of years of relations with domestic animals to consider our pets such charges in need of our care.\n\nIn addition to the natural nurturing element at play above, it is important to remember that we are regularly bombarded by stories of brutality perpetrated against humans by humans. In this process, we are desensitized. However, we also have come to expect, by data and anecdote, man's many unkindnesses against man. For this reason, it seems predictable that your typical person would struggle with a story of brutality against an animal in comparison to a human. In writing this, I personally struggle with my own vision of such things far worse than my visions of human suffering!\n\nIt is a non sequitur, I believe, to conflate the disturbances we feel regarding animal cruelty with the above question of focusing on animal welfare in light of human suffering. One of those things is a question of where we put our mental energy - of which we practically have an unlimited amount. Another of those is a very real question of economic and practical scarcity - in a world full of suffering, to focus on one being's suffering over another is to deprive another of your focus. The two need not be conflated - it is natural and common to focus unduly on animal suffering in light of a world filled with terrors for all animals, humans included. It does not necessarily follow that we view this focus on animal suffering as the zero sum game of resource and labor allocation to alleviate very real human and animal suffering alike", "path": "./logs/pilot/6eea3f61f46c466ebbac1960d34aef81.jsonl", "prompt": "Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, keeping up with current events provides a person with an informed opinion of their surroundings. Whether it determines the character of a citizen depends on whether that citizen has the moral responsibility to be informed. With the current degree of freedom, such as the right to not vote, keeping up with the news is a personal choice. Yet, a lack of effort to be informed of a topic and still form an opinion can be seen as forceful ignorance, which can have detrimental effects on societal progression. Therefore, it is bad because a person is choosing to neglect their social responsibility to put forth their best effort toward social progression. \n\nInformation is constantly evolving. New scientific discoveries, for example, can change how issues are perceived by the public. If a person neglect keeping up with current events, they may endeavor to support issues or believe in ideas that are no longer relevant to society, and that may inhibit social progress. If social progress is inhibited by one person, that person becomes a burden for others, and it results in an unequal share of responsibility and power. This inequality damages the moral fabric of society. When that fabric is damaged, it reduces the prerogative to make morally sound decisions. That would determine the poor character of a citizen. \n\nOn the other hand, a person can't always keep up with all of the news. So, in a way, they are unavoidably bound to make some poor decisions.

As there is not always a way of determining whether they are keeping up with it, it is best to assume that others' opinions are informed in order to promote social cohesion.

It is a very common belief that watching the news is an essential part of being a responsible citizen. However, I personally do not feel that this is at all the case. It\u2019s very important for us as a society to recognize that there are many ways to stay informed and engaged with the world around us (that do not include regular viewing of televised or paper news platforms). Some of these ways of staying engaged with the world around us can include listening to podcasts, reading online articles and forums as well as discussing current events with friends or family!\n\nThere are actually many \u201cdangers\u201d of watching the news, especially in today\u2019s day and age when we never really know what level of information we are going to see pop up on our screen.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, it is imperative for a citizen of a democracy to keep up with the news. However, I wouldn't necessarily call a person who is ignorant or disconnected from the news a \"bad\" person, but maybe a less \"valuable\" member of the democratic process. I think for a society so reliant on technology and information, the fast pace of technological advancements and new information makes keeping up with the news a necessity. I think it is a common trend in recent years to see individuals expect others to \"keep them in the loop\", or to be educated by others, especially when it comes to recent events, rather than finding information on their own. Now, there is no inherent issue with communicating with others when engaging with current events to listen to different viewpoints and form your own perspective, but I think any individual who wants to actually keep up with the news, must be able to at least begin the process of forming their own opinions and having the means of finding and analyzing news sources, otherwise they will likely be left behind.\n\nThe actual engagement with current events does, in my opinion, absolutely have an effect on both an individual level and a societal level. The unfortunate reality is that there is oftentimes too much news to keep up with, or too many current events occurring for any one person to keep up with, so I find it hard to necessarily blame anyone for not fully keeping up with current events. At the end of the day, you must prioritize your own personal events to some degree. However, the importance, or impact, of certain current events and subjects of the news are varying, and some events, such as global pandemics, are incredibly important to be kept up with, and I do consider that a \"responsibility\" of any \"good citizen\", and the lack of engagement with the news and current events, namely with the example of a global pandemic, can have very dire consequences for an individual and the people around them.\n\nI came to these conclusions primarily through lived experience, and as a 20 year old, have only lived in an \"age\" where access to information (and misinformation) is nearly infinite. So, with such vast and open access to information through technological advancements such as the internet, I both recognize the importance of keeping up with current events, but also understand just how much news there really is for a single person to keep up with. Having lived in the United States my whole life, recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a divisive political climate have shaped the way I view information and misinformation, and I have found that people who are ignorant of the news or \"disconnected\" from it are usually not without access to the information or the news. Rather, they either deem it too \"confusing\", or divisive, or a waste of time, when in reality they are likely actively feeling the effects of current events in their day to day lives, they just might not be aware", "path": "./logs/pilot/aa8b63ca838b407996b5bce0f95489cc.jsonl", "prompt": "Are We Being Bad Citizens If We Don't Keep Up With the News?\n\nIn your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I do believe we have a responsibility to know what is happening in the world. Over the last few years, we have seen especially fraught social and political times. Staying informed and aware of what is happening, minimally in one's community, is an important aspect of being a \"good\" citizen. \n\nIf one is informed about the events of their community, they have more power in doing something to change what they may dislike. Take homelessness as an example, if one sees that there is a group of unhoused people congregating near their home, they may feel unsafe or complain about this problem. However, if they do not choose to engage in what has drawn people to this type of living, they can not aid in the process to do something about it. It is similar to the saying about voting in America - if you don't vote you can't complain about who wins. \n\nThe question of the effect of engaging with current events is truly up to the person who is doing so. One can choose to know every bit of information happening in their community or the world at large and this may empower them to volunteer, donate, etc. Or, one can be informed and choose to do nothing at all with the information they receive. However, plainly engaging with current events at face value does not automatically \"do anything\" as the prompt suggests. \n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, it is necessary to stay informed on what is happening in your community on a small and large scale.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I think that everyone should be aware of what is going on with the current state of the world to an extent.  For example, do I think that my children who are elementary school age should be fearful of a possible World War 3?  Absolutely not. However, should adults be aware of possible threats to our nation?  Without a doubt they should.  While engaging with the current events may not necessarily do anything, it does allow for people to prepare for what may come.  Not only when it comes to possible wars, but even something as simple as being able to prepare for a possible hurricane or tropical storm.  \n\nWith that said, I understand why some people do not keep up with current events.  Watching the news is completely bias depending on which station you are watching.  If you are watching Fox News than Trump is a God and Biden is the devil.  Tune in to a different channel and suddenly the roles are switched.  The bias makes it difficult because truthfully no one is getting accurate news but rather the agenda from whichever party the news channel sides with.  I also know many people who don't watch the news because it is filled with doom and gloom.  Every day there are possible risks and new scary situations that can take someone who struggles with mental health to the edge.\n\nI feel that knowing the state of the world is important so that I am not blind sided.  As a child, I would read the newspaper with my grandparents every morning because they always told me it is better to be informed than to be ignorant to what is happening.  I also feel that news is bias as I watched what has unfolded over the last few years.  As a Republican, I by no means think that Trump is the god that Fox made him out to be, but I also think he did a lot of good that was overlooked due to the political affiliations of certain news stations.

{"essay": "\nI believe avoiding news content does not make a person a bad citizen. Although a person might not be informed about current events, they still might be involved in other ways. One might define a \"bad citizen\" as someone who doesn't care about others, their beliefs/values or culture. Simply because a person does not follow the news does not automatically mean they don't care about others. Not keeping up with the news does not make a person a bad citizen because of mental health considerations, personal priorities and obligations, and the fact that there are alternate forms of civic engagement to be considered.  \n\nIt is crucial to recognize that it is okay for a person not to follow the news, especially when prioritizing mental health considerations. Constant exposure to news, which often includes distressing and negative stories, can significantly impact one's emotional well-being. For some individuals, this inundation of information can lead to heightened anxiety, stress, and even feelings of hopelessness. Taking a step back from the news cycle allows individuals to create a healthier mental space, protecting their emotional resilience and fostering a more positive mindset. By consciously choosing to limit news consumption, individuals can focus on self-care, engaging in activities that bring them joy, and cultivating meaningful connections with others. Ultimately, safeguarding one's mental health should be a priority, and opting out of news consumption can be a valid and empowering choice.\n\nIn addition, a person might not be able to follow the news because of personal priorities and obligations. This does not make them bad citizens, because they are likely contributing in other ways by tending to these personal duties. For example, a single mother might not watch the news on a regular basis, but she is contributing by raising the next generation. A person who works long hours at their job most likely would be too tired to watch the news after a hard day, but that does not mean they do not care about other people. Ultimately a person shouldn't be judged for not watching the news. \n\n\nThe act of not watching the news does not inherently make someone a bad person, as there are various ways to demonstrate civic engagement beyond news consumption. While staying informed about current events is valuable for understanding the world around us, it is important to acknowledge that individuals can contribute to their communities and society in numerous other meaningful ways. Civic engagement encompasses a wide range of actions, such as volunteering for local organizations, participating in community projects, engaging in political activism, or working towards social change through personal initiatives. By actively participating in these endeavors, individuals can make a positive impact and contribute to the betterment of society, even without being fully immersed in the news cycle. It is crucial to remember that civic engagement goes beyond simply being informed, and it is through action and involvement that individuals can truly make a difference in their communities, regardless of their news consumption habits.\n\nI believe that not watching the news does not classify a person as a bad citizen. While an individual may not be up to date with current events, they can still actively engage in various other ways. The choice to not follow the news does not automatically imply a lack of concern for others. Mental health considerations, personal priorities, and obligations can influence an individual's decision to limit news exposure.  Therefore, it is unjust to label someone as a bad citizen solely based on their decision to not keep up with the news.\n\n\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/b3303daacc784d0583f0a8698e97b06b.jsonl", "prompt": "Are We Being Bad Citizens If We Don't Keep Up With the News?\n\nIn your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make us bad citizens. While the news might keep us up to date on the most recent events, that does not mean that it will always be helpful to us.

{"essay": "\nThere is No Moral Imperative to Remain Apprised\n\nIn the earliest days of defining a \"good citizen\", one had to stay apprised of the latest events in the family, village, state, or nation-unit. There is no such imperative today. As we are barraged by the misery pornography that is National and International Current Events, it is, in fact, becoming more important than ever that individuals  take a bastardized page from the book of Timothy Leary and just simply drop out - no turning on or tuning in necessary. \n\nMass Casulaty events plague the collective consciousness of the typical American citizen, and despite tremendous and unprecedented public outreach to elected officials, it appears as though a typical citizen's civic value is not correlated in any meaningful way to the degree which they remain abreast of the latest massacre in the homeland. Similarly, since the mid-nineteenth century, a deluge of sensationalized celebrity gossip and tawdry embarrassments has ensured that our social fight-or-flight response is engaged each time we learn who Pete Davidson has socially deflowered next. There is simply no biological, evolutionary, or civic reason why human beings should remain aware of this information. Prior to the advent of the internet and monetized ad-supported current events publishing, the value of a well-informed citizen was that they were able to make educated decisions about local, state, and national matters. In an era of disinformation at worst and \"too much information\" (with apologies to Gordon Sumner) at best, too much of a good thing (i.e. the news) is indeed a bad thing.\n\nNot all people have a responsibility to remain painfully apprised of current events at home and abroad. There is little value added, for instance, in youngsters entering their school day up-to-date with the bleeding edge of information about the latest massacre of children at an American school. In fact, this sort of Dellilian White Noise serves only to exacerbate the deep insecurities and anxieties the typical American child faces. This is not a problem unique to American society too; the so-called \"grass-eaters\" of Japan and China learned some decades ago that many days, it feels more mentally relaxing and fulfilling to simply muse on the nature of our favorite \"waifus\" and ignore the world more generally. The cocoon of ignorance has long given shelter to the fearful and world-weary; only now has it proven a safe haven from the ills of a sick society.\n\nWhile the above may excoriate the twitter-addicted and perennially online, there is some argument to be made that a relative education and sensibility about current events makes a better and more cosmopolitan citizen. However, even if we were to examine the value of news as such in a strictly utilitarian sense, there is little to indicate that the major depressive effects of an informational diet of current events, tragedies, and elections does anything other than make the nervous minded weep and gnash their teeth. Most studies of public policy indicate that, despite our best efforts, most democratic processes rely little on ifnromation parity, and rely more on the time-tested electoral values of \"Who is more attractive?,\" \"which candidate has more money from private massively wealthy donators,\" and \"which presidential candidate is taller?\".

It can be a very immersive experience because the reader can make the characters come to life, and sometimes the emotions of the mother or father especially hit you that much more. For visual learners, it may be difficult to understand the story because you must use your imagination to think of what the scene looks like, which may be difficult.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there will never be any sort of technology that can replace the tactile, multisensory experience of reading a bound book.

{"essay": "\nI find that listening to audiobooks can be a great thing when I am not able to physically read a book. I am an avid reader. I began reading at the age of 3 and haven't stopped. \t\n\nOne of the benefits of listening to a book is that it can be with you when you are on the go. I travel often, and I've worked in large cities where the commute from home to work can often take upwards of an hour. It's wonderful to be able to still enjoy good literature when I am in the car. Along this same line, I think listening to audiobooks when on car trips is an excellent thing for children of all ages. I have five brothers and sisters. When you have six children and two parents in a car for any length of time, it will get loud and chaotic. It is of paramount importance to have plenty of options when traveling with kids! I have fond memories of traveling with my family and listening to audiobooks while also crocheting or doing embroidery while my younger siblings drew pictures and my older siblings were occupied with crossword puzzles or other pursuits. \n\nOther advantages of listening to audiobooks are that you can listen to books as you exercise, do outdoor activities such as hiking, you can listen while you do housework or shop, and more! The options are almost limitless. When you consider the many genres of books on audio, and that you are not limited to novels, it opens doors to a world of learning and opportunities. You can learn to handle finances better, explore cuisine from other countries, study history, learn a new language, and anything else. With all this and more at your disposal, it would be crazy to pass it all up. \n\nHowever, I think that reading a book is also very important. The physical act of reading a book has an untold value that sadly, the younger generations today are very unaware of. First and foremost, skill and fluency in reading and interpreting written langue are dropping. So is reading comprehension. How can it not when almost every single person is glued to a screen? \n\nFor me, and I think for many others, reading is a way to leave the world you know and travel to another. It opens doors to the unknown and gives the reader the ability to experience things they might otherwise never see or know. Of course, this takes place in the imagination, the mind's eye. But allowing that to develop as time goes on gives a person a broad and vivid view of life and the world that I've not seen replicated any other way. It also teaches the reader about human nature, and how to relate to people different from themselves.\n\nI could give many more reasons that reading a book is a wonderful and worthwhile endeavor. I do prefer reading a book over listening to an audiobook. But I can see the benefit of both. I think a lot depends on the individual, how they learn and process information, and what method works the best for them.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are pros and cons to both ways of taking in the information that is written, but overall, reading the written word significantly increases the odds of retaining the information that is expressed through writing or print. However, I would say that retention of information via reading vs. listening is not always better. By my estimate, when taking in technical information or information that needs to be studied, memorized, or learned, reading is definitely the way to go. This is because you can see the words and figures and can make annotations and the like to help reinforce the learning that must be done. This dovetails with a more commonly used term, note-taking, which allows us to visualize and form mnemonics that support the memorization process. No doubt about it, in my mind, when I need to learn something, actually reading it makes all the difference!\n\nAbove, I argued that reading is the better way to take in the written word to help you \"remember.\" I will now play devil's advocate for a moment. On the other side of the reading vs. listening coin, listening. While listening may not be the best way to take in technical information to \"remember,\" anyone who has ever listened to a really great audiobook with a really great narrator can probably tell you that they can remember a great deal about the book they are listening to. Of course, a poor narrator can either make or break a book and even cause that potentially great book to be shelved into the basement of the mind and very likely not retain much about the story at all. But the narrator that can bring the characters to life can make the book pop in the mind's eye in a way that is often just as engrossing as favorite shows or movies that stimulate the mind. I can even think of audiobooks I have listened to that stick with me for years and can even have geographic associations mapped similar to the way a scent might remind a person of someone they once knew. That is to say, when I pass by a certain location, street, neighborhood, etc., in my car, I can remember a part of a book that I was listening to when I was in that street, neighborhood, etc. It is pretty neat to say the least.\n\nTo bring it all back to where I started, arguing that actually reading was better than listening, there is one more feather in the reading-over-listening argument that is critical for aspiring writers of nearly any sort. If all you do is listen to books, you do not get a lot of the valuable information that you would otherwise miss out on just listening. Actually, reading affords us not just the context of the words strung along to pass on the point of whatever the author wishes to say, it also can and does passively teach us every time we read. That is, our vocabulary improves because we have a much richer tapestry of words that we actually see. Seeing words teaches us how they look and how they might be used by us in the future. This is critical for anyone who aims to have even a slightly better lexicon to draw from vs. someone who has not seen said words in print. Another example of this might be simply understanding how to use certain literary devices when writing ourselves. The example that comes to mind for me is dialog. Dialog is a lot more than he said, she said. But if we never see it in print, we are not as likely to know how to produce it ourselves should the need or desire ever emerge.

On top of all of this, listening is especially enjoyable if the narrator reflects tone and inflections into the voice. \n\nBut at the end of the day, I'll tell you this. There are some advantages that can only be gained by reading. Not only will reading help to improve your brain, it is more efficient if you plan to learn from what you're reading/listening to. Reading helps to improve memory retention, creative thinking, vocabulary, and so much more. So while I prefer listening 100%, if the content was super interesting (I'd know from the intro), I would choose to read it because of that creative benefit.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, to a book is better than reading it. I have listened to books and also read other books and the former is better than the latter. The audio books can have the benefit of having the authors voice as the narrator, which brings out a better experience. For me, the experience is much better than reading because of the tonal variations used provide a better delivery than when one is reading the book. As a result, the listener better understands the emotions of the narrator compared to a scenario where one has to use his own voice when reading the same book. In the end, one does not miss out on the authors intentions when writing the book. \nThe other benefit of audiobooks is that one can multitask when listening to the book. For example, one can listen to the book while driving, in the gym, cooking or performing activities that can be done alone. On the other hand, reading a book does not allow one to multitask, but one can read a book while traveling. However, there are limitations to the multitasking attribute of reading a book. Such a benefit of an audiobook has allowed more people to have interests in books because they do not have to change their schedule. Most people do not have the capacity to integrate book reading because one needs extra focus and a quiet environment to do so.\nThere are many digital devices that have emerged that are also beneficial for audiobooks. For example, there are smartphones that allow people to listen to the books wherever they are. Thus, there is no burden of carrying the physical book when traveling to another country or region. In fact, one can have access to a large library where there are numerous books at the click of a button. The availability of the books on digital devices has also benefitted the authors who have more reach with their books, which can be converted to sales. As a result, there is a win win situation for both the reader and the author. \nThe one benefit that I see in reading books is one has the ability to take notes and highlight key chapters that are relevant. Therefore, one interacts better with a physical book when trying to understand what is being shared. As a result, there is more understanding of the information that is being provided compared to listening to the same book. Even though physical books have the benefit mentioned above and one can also have the book as a souvenir, I prefer audiobooks. The audiobooks allow me to listen to many books in a week or a month compared to reading a book.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I think listening to a book is just as good as reading it. It's a convenient way for someone to get into books if they just don't have the ability to actually sit and read a physical book. Actually sitting down and reading a book requires one to set time aside to pay attention to what's physically in front of them, whereas an audiobook allows you to listen to it wherever and whenever. You don't have to make a choice to do one thing over the other when it comes to listening to audiobooks and I don't think that there are such outstanding advantages choosing one over the other.\n\nIn addition to convenience, sometimes audiobooks help invoke more feeling when you're able to hear the intended tone that the book was written in. Personally, I find myself struggling to understand what tone the narrator might be speaking in when I am reading a book, but when I am listening to an audiobook, it's a little clearer. Then again, some may see that as an advantage of reading a book because things can be left up for interpretation and you get different perspectives on a story depending on the reader. Again, not a major difference between listening and reading that makes one better over the other.\n\nSome may argue that reading is better than listening because it can be easy to get distracted while multitasking and and listening. If you're splitting your attention between listening to an audiobook and driving, for example, something may occur on the road, causing you to miss a detail or two. If you're taking the time to focus on reading a physical book, you're able to easily look back at a line or reread a line. However, as I mentioned before, I don't this is a make or break against either of the two modes.\n\nI personally prefer to read a physical book, but not because I think it's better in any significant way, but because I just enjoy the turning of pages, and having the ability to reread a part or two over, to maybe look at the scene in a different light. It's more about the experience or the moments I spend focusing on a book that make reading versus listening more enjoyable to me. I'm also easily distracted so I don't think audiobooks would always work for me. Do I listen to audiobooks? Yes, but given the option, I would opt for a physical book.\n\nThere are differences in the two, however, I don't think one is inherently better than the other. My preference is to read a physical book, but I don't think listening to one takes away from the book itself and/or the contents of it. I think it's just a matter of preference based on the smallest differences with the biggest difference of the two being the convenience of listening to a book, but that's not a great enough difference to rule out one over the other.", "path": "./logs/pilot/7eb3fd0b8bf7415a919be1f99ff6a9be.jsonl", "prompt": "Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?\n\nDo you listen to audiobooks?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, reading is a good learning method because it aids faster comprehension and retention. However, it does not disprove the fact that audiobooks are a convenient learning method that offers credible benefits, particularly because they allow listeners to understand the tone and mood of the speaker in a book. Audiobooks allow listeners to understand a writer's inflections and intonations, compared to reading, where a reader is left to decode the meaning on their own. Moreover, the emotions of a narrator, such as sarcasm, are better conveyed via audiobooks than printed books. \n\nAudiobooks are more flexible because one can easily listen to them anytime, in spite of busy schedules. Just like one can listen to music when performing a chore, driving, cooking, or running errands, listening makes learning more flexible and convenient. Listening offers a different experience because it helps listeners visualize the story being told more clearly, especially when the narrator is a great storyteller. However, this does not guarantee comprehension or a better understanding because multitasking when listening to audiobooks may impede learning. \n\nOn the other hand, reading a book has so many advantages that cannot be achieved solely by listening to an audiobook or recording. Reading makes it easy to return to information you probably missed out on, compared to listening to an audiobook. Compared to reading, a reader can conveniently highlight a part of a book they cannot really understand when reading to make clarifications to aid learning. Since most readers prefer a comfortable and serene environment where there are no distractions to understand better, reading encourages one to be more focused. \n\n Personally, I believe there isn't much difference between reading and learning because they both aid learning, and it depends on the preferences of an individual. However, I prefer reading to listening to audiobooks because it is a relaxing activity that helps me take my mind off any distractions while aiding my imaginative and retentive skills, which I believe I can't enjoy solely by listening to an audiobook.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, listening to a book will never be the same as reading a book, but I'm not anti listening. I just prefer holding a book in hands and seeing the words over holding it in my ears and hearing them. \n\nFirst off, I haven't listened to a book in many years and, in fact, can't remember when I last listened to a book. I do have friends who listen to books and they seem to enjoy it. They've actually \"read\" more books this way than me in recent years! I'll get to my personal thoughts but first, let's look into why someone might prefer listening over reading. \n\nWe live in a busy world. I know the clich\u00e9 is that with technology advancing we'll find more time for leisurely activities, but that continues to not be true. If anything, technology has made us busier. So, who has time to sit down and read? We're also commuting longer distances to places of employment and find ourselves stuck in traffic or on public transit, which are both opportune times to listen to books! \n\nSurely you can't pick up a book while driving your car, or at least you shouldn't, but you can listen to that book series you've been meaning to read but refuse to find the time for at home. If you're not tasked with the very important responsibility to operating a vehicle, and are on public transit, then save yourself the trouble of lugging around a big books or several magazines by just listening in. Listening to a book while traveling to and from work might also help you mentally prepare yourself for the day or wind down after a long day at the office. It's the perfect escape when you're otherwise trapped (in a car or train or etc.). \n\nAnother time that listening would make sense but you feel absolutely guilty for not being more constructive with your time is when you're doing housework. I often listen to podcasts while cleaning and would probably find this a good time to listen to a book. I might even be convinced to clean longer! \n\nThat said, I prefer the experience of reading a physical book. It's easier for my imagination to inhabit the world of the story. I can pause more easily and reread sections to understand what's going on or give my imagination time to construct a scene. I can put myself in the scenes to explore how the emergent emotions or dilemmas. Maybe a certain scene was just that good and I want to reread \u2013 give my eyes and mind time to explore the words and their meanings.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion,  comparing that of listening to a book and that of reading and looking at a physical book is completely different because you absorb intonation in different ways. Because our senses give us different ways of understanding and processing information, we either read off of a page or heard it from our phone. Reading and listening to a book is in other worlds when it comes to what and how we understand the end of the book. Audiobooks and physical copies of books do get us to the same goal, but along the way, we can take different paths to get to the goal.\n\nWhen we are talking about the advantages of reading or listening to a book, we should think about how each type could affect us. For example, when we are reading a physical book, we are able to go back easily and reread, but an audiobook has its difficulties, also if happens that we are reading and don't understand a phrase, we can also read on our own pace, which gives us the ability to understand the text as fast or as slow as we want. When we are listening to a book, the advantages are that we can hear the tone and be able to understand the emotions in a different aspect than when we are reading.\n\nWhen looking at how audiobooks differ from reading a physical copy, we can gather that the speed at which you listen to the book is much more set in stone than that of the physical copy of the book. Then, in turn, it would mean that the rate of information absorbed will be more consistent because of how it is being heard by the speaker. Audiobooks also have the huge advantage of that give us the emotion of how conversations are said and understood. In conclusion, audiobooks have certain advantages that physical books don't offer. \n\nWhen we are comparing physical books to audiobooks, they also have different advantages because how audiobooks are so new, we haven't been able to master the art of audiobooks because they are so known, and how every book can be taken differently in terms of tone and the meaning of conversations between characters and even the own voice of the narrative. Books have been around since before we even called them a book. We have had ample time to improve on how books provide knowledge to the reader. Books just have a more in-depth way of telling the story in a more personal way that is different for each reader. I would prefer to read a physical copy of a book because of all the reasons I talked about, and also, it is just easier to understand and give my full or mostly full attention to. \n\nIn final conclusion, we are more advanced with physical books rather than having someone else read the book to us because of how we understand the book and everything in the book. Books also are much easier to use in the sense that you don't need a battery for a book or a speaker. Also, to make a note of the fact it is much easier to get distracted by someone while you are trying to listen to a book, and then not being able to understand the last few seconds of what was just said doesn't happen with a physical copy of a book because, for the most part, you have to give your full attention to the book.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I do not support paying college athletes. The claim by McDavis is persuasive because it points out the polarization that will take place in the college sports. The existence of college sports is based on the fact that the players do not get similar perks as professional entities. Therefore, allowing the players to be paid will also lead to more focus on the sports and a shift from the core reason the students are part of the college, which is to learn. Colleges are in place to ensure that the community educates its children and when money comes into play, parents and students start focusing on ways to benefit. The community changes its perspective and more children are enrolled to colleges so that they can earn instead of gaining an education. Such observations show how the paying of athletes should only take place at the professional level. \nBesides, the demographics of people who make it in college sports are usually from the marginalized groups such as African Americans and Latino communities. Such groups are already struggling with gaining education and they are also from impoverished settings, which means pushing the students to join sports will become a priority while there are also other opportunities that exist in the career world. Getting large sums of money at the college sport level would be a plausible goal for the community than joining other professionals, which can be a gamble.\nThe quality of education at the colleges will be compromised because every college would want to have the best athletes. Hence, there would be an increase in colleges wanting part of the money because they have played a large part in the development of the student athletes. There will also be disparity in the colleges with the ones that have large resources claiming the cream of the athletes and the other fighting for the rest. In a capitalist society whenever there is money involved every sector considers its bottom line. The sports world has a lot of money from broadcasting and endorsements that creates an ethical issue for the college fraternity.\nSince, the minorities are also most of the people who are in sports as mentioned earlier, there is also the issue of the community being taken advantage of by the corporate world. The issue is already with us not but it starts after college and providing money to young athletes at such a young age creates many concerns. Knowing one's value at a young age is also subjective and most of the money provided may not match the benefits that the student athlete brings to the college and later on to the professional team that signs him or her.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I do believe that college athletes should be paid, even in addition to other monetary incentives like scholarships or non-monetary incentives. Like major league athletes, college sports athletes are part of a business and should be compensated for it. I think that just the fact that they help generate so much money for their school justifies them receiving some kind of payment. The industry can afford to do so and just as employees of every business expect to get paid, college athletes should receive the same.\n\nMcDavis does make a good point by pointing out how this could distort the economics of college sports, but honestly, its the risk that comes with the reward. Just as the major leagues is a business, college sports is just a lower level of the same kind of business. College athletes get to enjoy the perks that come with being on the team, for example, free tuition, but do I think that it should be capped at just that? No, especially since college sports is such a big money maker in terms of brand deals, streaming, etc; if schools can afford to, I think that they should. It is a choice by the athlete to join these college sports teams and if the incentives do not meet their requirements, then they are free to pass. \n\nWhile I think that they should be paid if the school can afford to, I do not think it's something that should be required. As I mentioned, college athletes can choose which schools they want to play for based on a number of things, including the incentives that come with playing for them. While I definitely think it should be an option, if the school is in a financial position that allows them to, I also do agree that there are other monetary and non-monetary incentives that come with college sports that athletes can benefit from.\n\nOne of my biggest reasons as to why I think college athletes should be paid is because the money can help these college students establish a foundation post-college. With the numbers that college sports generates, players would be able to generate some form of income before they're thrown into the real world. We want to set these students up for success and having a well paying job as a college student can do that.\n\nIn addition to helping setting up a foundation for them post-college, I think that college athletes put in almost as much if not as much work as major league athletes do. They are constantly training and traveling for games and those take physical tolls on the body. Schools are putting their athletes through rigorous physical activities, regularly, in order to generate money for these schools, so the least school can do is give back a little bit to those athletes.\n\nIn conclusion, I do believe that college athletes should be paid. While there are other perks of being a college athlete, I think the amount schools get paid for these athletes is disproportionate to the perks or monetary or non-monetary incentives they are currently offered.", "path": "./logs/pilot/63dcb6af629d4419a258cf1909760dbc.jsonl", "prompt": "Should College Athletes Be Paid?\n\nDo you think college athletes should be paid?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, Cody J. McDavis has a point. The biggest schools in the nation would poach all the top talent and form super-teams that the rest of the league could not compete with. This has the potential to be a major issue. However, this is already happening. The highest-value high school recruits are already going to established programs where they feel they will have a better chance of succeeding.\n\nIt is also profoundly unfair that these athletes bring in so much revenue for the school and are not fairly compensated for this added revenue. It is even more unfair when it is considered the attention successful sports teams bring to their respective universities around the country. And when it is considered how much their coaches are paid, the players are rightly feeling hard done by. It is particularly unfair when it is considered that universities not only sell jerseys with the athlete's name on the back but other types of merchandise using student-athletes names and/or likenesses.\n\nHowever, there could be some difficulties in providing monetary compensation to student-athletes. First off, debates over how athletes should be paid would be a concern. Are all athletes paid or only the men's football and basketball teams? Are they paid on a salary or are there bonuses? There is also the problem of where the money would come from. Universities would have to either cut programs, lay off staff, or increase tuition, raising problems for the average student who attends these universities.\n\nIn my opinion, that is the biggest concern of paying student-athletes, how it will affect the average student attending that school, and how it could motivate high school students to apply to other non-paying schools. Another note is that by paying student-athletes, it makes it even more clear that their education is second to their athletic career. For all students in college, their main focus should be to complete their education and earn their degree. However, students who are already being paid to play sports are almost guaranteed to lose any motivation they have to get homework done on time and attend all their classes. \n\nI would argue McDavis' argument is persuasive but could be improved or elaborated on. \tHe raises the point of a couple of consequences that could be faced should student-athletes be paid that the casual fan may not have considered.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, his argument is not terribly persuasive. It seems reminiscent of every argument that has historically been made to justify poor working conditions. Weekends, overtime, the 40 hour workweek, job safety requirements, minimum wage, equal pay, these are all things workers of the past were told they couldn't have. Not just because employers didn't want to, but because their existence would disrupt the economy. Giving everyone a two day weekend would grind business to a halt, safety regulations would make it impossible for factories to function, paying men and women and minorities equally would bankrupt employers. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, many student athletes make their colleges thousands or millions of dollars. The NCAA (National Collegiate Athletics Association) have been reporting over a billion dollars in revenue for the last few years, and the president and other board members take home millions of that.  The fact that the people actually doing the work are not compensated while their colleges reap the rewards of their labor seems silly. While I believe athletes are extremely overpaid in general, it doesn't seem right that college students are expected to play for their schools, fully commit to classes, and maybe even have jobs to support themselves through all this. They are doing something which their school and society have decided is valuable, something that warrants the spending of money.  This is all without even taking into consideration the physical toll of sports like football, which could prevent the students from pursuing a sports career or continuing education.\n\nOf course there are genuine downsides to consider about paying student athletes. They may focus more on the sport than on school, and more on money than the sport itself. The one thing McDavis' argument does point out that I agree with is that rich schools may end up creating a monopoly on the student athlete industry. Students will be incentivized to go to the schools that pay the most (or pay at all) instead of smaller schools that would end have benefited from their presence. It might necessitate schools take funding away from programs that don't make the school money, like the arts or humanities. Or even if it isn't necessary, it could be held up as an excuse to further defund those kinds of subjects. Similarly, sports that are less lucrative might end up on the back burner or scrapped entirely, like taking tennis off the program to focus on college football.\n\nSo, while I don't find the spirit of his argument persuasive, I do think McDavis is right in that paying school athletes is not as straightforward an idea as it appears on its face. While it sounds fair and reasonable, as with anything involving money or education, issues of fairness are never straightforward. However, I think there is more to the conversation than he implies, and that the industry as a whole should still be re-examined for the way it treats and compensates students for their time, labor, and sacrfice.

{"essay": "\nThe idea of paying student athletes for their sport appeals to those concerned with fairness and equity, but in reality, this advocacy falls short of delivering on either. College sports have been for generations, are a sure way to generate revenue and publicity for higher education. Certain aspiring athletes make their determination for schools based on public attention and notoriety within a given sport. Once the student has one choice or many, the remaining chief concern is affordability. However, the idea of paying student athletes would convert the college experience from a time of character-building and self-discovery to one of ill-prepared professionalism where students maintain a tenuous hold on income.\n\nCollege students are former high school students, and like any high school student, there are a myriad of scholarships available for higher education. Student athletes have more scholarship opportunities, and larger scholarship amounts, available to them than those on other tracks such as the arts or languages. This feature of the higher education system means a removal of financial anxiety that plagues most college students. Moreover, college students are also like high school students in that they're the examples we point to of people who make bad decisions for lack of maturity and wisdom. Without fully developed brains, or the experiences yet to teach them, a robust income would leave this ill-equipped students open to the same problems professional athletes face - drugs, gambling, and other vices. The stereotypical struggles of a college athlete would be worsened.\n\nThe proposed income idea would financially benefit students in the short term, but would eventually would render generations to come with a lacking amount of opportunities. Scholarships would disappear in the face of schools offering compensation. Schools would have to develop a system of determining which athletes to pay and how much to pay, inevitably leading to speculation about bias and discrimination. On the university level, paying student athletes would create a hierarchy that is present in professional sports, but the schools with the most money would be the universities with the best players. Students who live far away from affluent areas could be less likely to attend for non-financial reasons, like needing to help a sick relative. And rather than an obscure school acquiring a star-athlete by chance, the opportunity becomes void due to the bidding process. The top schools will naturally retain their titles, and with that, the top athletes.\n\nCollege is a building-block for athletes toward professionalism, not the starting point. Neither football nor basketball on the university level are as big as their professional counterparts, but they are all the same known even by those who don't watch sports. This gives the high school student has an idea of what to expect, but a vision is only a vision. A minor is not able to fully conceptualize how to manage their money or make wise investments. While athletes generate money for a university, the university is also providing for them - an education, room and board, life-changing experiences, exposure within their field. When considering this subject from a practical perspective, all things equal out. And the fact remains, when any student graduates and becomes successful, their lives point back to the university that produced them. Fairness and equity remain obscure concepts, but there's certainty in what colleges get from their student athletes, and in what they provide.", "path": "./logs/pilot/7e5eaf53f4f84f83863a25098f3199d5.jsonl", "prompt": "Should College Athletes Be Paid?\n\nDo you think college athletes should be paid?

Okay, he didn't say it like that. But think about it. Paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports and in no time, it will affect the entire school system. What if the college can't afford to pay? What if the star player starts to request for a ridiculous amount? What if the college athlete start to act and feel superior to the rest of the other students? What if other extra-curricular departments start to ask for the same treatment? What will happen then?\n\nThere are already college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans. This, I believe is enough gratification for a student athlete. When the student is done with school, and moves on to become a full-time professional athlete, payment will no longer be an option.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, paying student-athletes is not a bad idea since they help schools earn money and exposure, but providing monetary compensation is not the best bet. Judging by the fact that these college-athletes are often driven by passion, which has helped them stand out as athletes, paying college-athletes will reduce the uniqueness of the sport. In this case, many schools will struggle to pay their athletes because of the financial strain in sports, which can also result in dismissing minor sports to pay athletes competing in popular sports. While the rich schools may not have to deal with the issue of paying their athletes because they have the capabilities, other schools that choose to embark on paying athletes apart from the regular scholarships and exposure they get will find it difficult to keep up with such additional  monetary responsibility. \n\nPaying college athletes is bad economics because it will be difficult to determine their salaries and will widen the gap between the haves and have-nots. Deciding who gets to have the highest pay and who determines the pay will also be very difficult. Athletic competition, which is often based on competence, will then become a battle between those who are best positioned to win the bidding war and those who have limited budgets. In this case, I believe the whole essence of college sports will be misplaced if schools decide to provide monetary compensation for college athletes apart from the regular scholarships and benefits they get. \n\nAlso, I think that many players will lose their love for the game when monetary compensation gets involved because paying these student-athletes will turn them into professionals and reduce the beauty of amateur athletic competition. First off, these college-athletes were students before deciding to compete in their preferred sports. So if anything, these college-athletes should participate in sports for the love of the game and their passion and not primarily for financial gain because it helps them remain a part of the college community. Not only will it help distinguish college athletes from their professional counterparts, but it also gives them an advantage in acquiring a quality education that makes them valuable as athletes. \n\nLastly, while one cannot deny the fact that college athletes also need money apart from the scholarships, Cody J. McDavis is persuasive enough by saying that \"paying students to play would ruin college sports\". The excitement and the will to win will be lost, and there will not be much to look forward to in college sports. Due to the possible difficulties that might arise with monetary compensation, coupled with the fact that these athletes have access to scholarships and grants, paying college athletes might not be a good option.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are a lot of answers to that question. For starters, to answer that question, there would be a lot of work and lots of discussing of details even before, such as who would be paying the athletes, would pay change depending on the sport, would all athletes be paid, and would pay be equal for all athletes? Various downsides also come with some positive points. This argument could be persuasive if more than one college pays athletes because that would prevent students from only migrating to one college for the money. Another point being that if students do sports just for the money, there would have to be a rule put in place so that only students who meet some amount of criteria would get paid, such as attendance, effort, and so on.\n\nThe topic of the possibility that college students would be paid for sports would be if enough rules were put into place so that students didn't abuse the fact that they could get paid while playing sports in college. The scale of if there are more downsides or upsides would have to depend on how the college decides to introduce the opportunity to get paid for competing sports. The downside of being paid for competitive sports mostly depends on the students and college setting the necessary rules. Another downside to consider is that if only one college is paying them, there could be more athletes than students from other schools that decided to transfer, but that also means that the school whose paying could become popular for that one fact. And in turn, it could also decrease other schools' popularity because they don't pay their athletes.\n\nBut to counter those downsides, there is a fair amount of positive points, such as the fact students who play sports will not be required to get a part-time job to cover misc costs and attendance, and students could see what it would be like after college if they decide to go pro or play for a team. Students could also get noticed by scouts for that respective sport because not every college will pay athletes, which could attract more scouts to watch athletes. Being paid for sports could also incentivize students to play competitively and, in turn, draw more attention to that institution's sports program.\n\nIn conclusion, we can see many downsides and positive points to students being paid for competitive sports. The reason is that I can only see college athletes being paid with a strong set of rules in place. Also, before any college can pay students, I believe that several colleges have to arrange to pay students together so that the balance is not upset by an influx of students transferring from one college that does not pay to a college that does.

You only live once and you are in your physical prime for an even shorter window within that so make hay while the sun shines.

The reason why it might be thought of as selfish is because if you get hurt, then your loved ones might have to take care of you. But in my opinion, this doesn't hold because that views this as a transaction where their love for you should be returned by you choosing 'safer' hobbies. As long as you personally accept the risk of your choices and you have a genuine relationship with your loved ones, I think they would understand and even maybe encourage you to follow your dreams.

For example, extreme mountain climbing can require the assistance of a team of trained professionals, and putting oneself in danger can also put those professionals at risk.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, everyone should have the option to choose whether or not they are going to participate in risky sport.  As mentioned within the prompt, all sports carry a risk of being dangerous. For example, walking on a golf course I could at any point roll my ankle or injure my shoulder. If someone wants to try something as extreme as mountain climbing or even play a high injury sport such as football, it should be the choice of the individual.  \n\nIn terms of drawing the line between what is reasonable and what is not, I think that also depends on the individual.

With that said, it is the most popular sport within the United States.  Would I consider mountain climbing a sport?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are many selfish downsides to \"extreme\" sports, especially when  it comes to mountain climbing.  For years, the inhabitants of places like Mount Everest have been begging people to stop climbing their mountain. A trek to the summit takes weeks, and results in a ton of abandoned equipment, trash, and human waste, as well as the corpses of more unfortunate climbers.  Unlike other extreme sports, like cave diving or ski boarding, mountain climbing has a measurable impact on the environment and people around the mountain. While one can argue all extreme sports require a degree of selfishness to put your life at risk for an adrenaline rush (ignoring  family and friends who may be affected by your death), mountain climbing stands out as an example of a sport with a negative effect on generations of people. \n\nThere are some who argue that mountain climbing is good for the economy of these places, that climbers \"create jobs\" for the people living nearby, in tourism, hospitality, and guide services.  It is true that due to consistent climbing tourism over the last century, the towns around Everest have grown economically, creating new opportunities for future generations.  However, that small influx of money does not seem to outweigh the concerns of the actual inhabitants. For one, it's not just the foreign travelers who perish on the slopes; of the 300 or so people who have died while climbing, around one-third are native Nepal Sherpas trying to lead these travelers up the mountain.   Especially recently, many younger generation Sherpas have been pushing their government to put more protections in place for guides, limit the number of climbers allowed, and at least attempt to clean up the mountain.\n\nWhen it comes to extreme sports, it is easy to write off the participants as selfish and stupid. However, for most sports, I would argue that the selfishness is limited in scope. One could argue that most are just as dangerous as a night of binge drinking, and just as selfish since excessive drinking not only puts you at risk of getting hurt, but can also lead to you doing things you regret, and even hurting others. But while we are quick to judge alcoholics for being selfish, we're also quick to praise them in recovery, and have even lessened some of our blame as a society now that we understand better how difficult it is to quit addictive substances.  There is a comparison to be drawn as to the selfish impact of both extreme sports and addiction.  But there isn't really a similar comparison to be made for how society views the sportsman vs the addict. \n\nMany people who partake in extreme sports compare the adrenaline rush to being on drugs.  If we take this as seriously as it is presented, the question of selfishness becomes more difficult.  Should we view people who like skydiving the same way we view addicts? Is any potential selfishness now tangled up with questions of dopamine overload and an inability to look at their hobby with clear, \"sober\" eyes? Should an addict who dies of an overdose be looked at with as much sympathy as a climber who disappears in an avalanche? Both leave behind grieving loved ones. Both died in pursuit of an ultimate high that much of society had begged them to give up. There are surely selfish downsides to extreme sports, but I believe there are more questions to be asked as we seek an answer to this question.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there is nothing inherently selfish about risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. It is one thing to consider an activity dangerous or dumb, and another to define it as \"selfish\", and I think that most actions that don't have a direct negative effect on someone else cannot be considered selfish. There are absolutely varying degrees of risk in most sports, though to different levels, and some might consider the risk to be a point of pride for their achievement. But, realistically, to call extreme or risky sports selfish feels like it takes away from the achievements of the athletes that do them.\n\nI'm not entirely sure there needs to be a line drawn anywhere between what is and isn't a sport, especially when you base it on the risks involved, because that risk might vary depending on the individual. For example, climbing Mount Everest used to be an extreme and risky challenge accomplished by very few, but it has now become a tourist destination with little (although not zero) risk involved, mainly due to the advancements in technology and experience in climbing of \"tour guides\" like the Nepali Sherpas. \n\nUltimately, there are some activities that should not be considered a \"sport\" in the same way that a game like basketball is, either due to its novelty, risk, or nature of it. While NASCAR or Formula 1 might be considered sports, illegal street racing isn't and shouldn't be due to the unregulated and risky nature of it. There are many extreme sports that have a significant risk involved, yet have a professional scene and experts in the sport who are unlikely to get injured or killed, so I think it really depends on if there is an organizing/ruling body that can monitor or \"officiate\" the activity in order for it to be a sport", "path": "./logs/pilot/5a5d4d01ffaf4fd48fb1769ac048d8b8.jsonl", "prompt": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, what sport someone plays should be determined by their passion for it. There are many different opportunities for people to participate in sports from an young age to when people are nearing the end of life. When it comes to a sport like extreme mountain climbing, there is a certain level of adrenaline involved that may push people toward the sport. It may be difficult for a person to find that type of feeling in any other activity that they participate in.\n\nDetermining whether the rush is worth the risk is up to the individual. In many more popular sports, like basketball, football and soccer, there is a cumulative effect of playing the sport that impacts the health of an athlete. Injuries from these sports, to ankles, knees and even to the head build up over time. While there does seem to be an inherent risk from mountain climbing due to other factors, like running into wild animals, finding food and other issues that aren't typical with regular sports, the risk of developing a progressing injury from other sports can be just as dangerous. People have varying levels of pain tolerance and how much they are willing to tolerate is up to the indiviudal\n\nWhen it comes to risk, there is no sport that is too dangerous to be defined as a sport.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the pursuit of risky sports is a highly subjective endeavor and whether or not it is selfish depends on the individual athlete, or participant. To any outsider, a dangerous sport is just that: dangerous. But to a highly functioning adherent, extreme levels of risk can be mitigated by skill and experience. So, is it more or less selfish for a highly proficient practitioner to pursue an activity that he or she can do at a high level without the same amount of risk as a beginner or novice? \n\nThere are other factors that play into just how selfish it is for an individual to play/do a high risk/danger sport/activity. What is the relative fitness of the individual engaging in the sport or activity? What is their level of commitment and justification? Though there is quite a bit of nuance to this last one, what is their age and ability to achieve success with this sport or activity? \n\nFor examples, let's take a look at mixed martial arts (MMA). While I would say that there is no age or skill level that should bar someone from learning and training in MMA, I would advise against someone in their mid-late 30s, who has never had any training, or much training, from pursuing a career in MMA. Or foolhardily as some celebrities have done, try to achieve a bucket list item of fighting in the cage. However, for someone who has a lifetime of experience in martial arts, actual fighting, and even cage fighting, the risk is still there but it is considerably less. \n\nThat said, MMA is a sport that punishes the body and head and it's no secret that younger fighters fare better than older fighters. That's because the body overtime recovers less quickly and less from certain injuries, especially joint and head injuries ,which will compound over time (you can only take so much head trauma/get concussed so many times in life). Though the level of risk is the same, their abilities to mitigate those risks are not. We see this all the time with older fighters who've been knocked out before \u2013 it takes much less to knock them out when their older. And their recovery is longer and less gauaranteed. \n\nStretching out our example above, a fighter in his or her late 30s who has a family and small children should have to consider more whether or not this decision is selfish than a younger fighter who doesn't have a family and kids to consider. We see this with older fighters who for personal reasons won't give up the ring/octagon even as their skill and abilities decline as their get older. Against the advice of families and medical professionals, they selfishly pursue the adrenaline rush of the cage. For them, the level of selfishness for trying to maintain their activity at the highest levels is, I think, much greater.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, whether a risky sport like extreme mountain climbing is \"selfish\" or not might be the wrong question to ask. Or, at least, the wrong question to ask alone. While true that pursuing sports with extremely high risks of injury or death are in a sense \"selfish\" in that if you're killed, it's your loved ones who have to suffer the consequences, on the other hand it's hard not to see that pursuing such a sport is each person's prerogative. Life is short. If doing what you love means doing something dangerous, it is my opinion that you should be able to pursue that passion regardless of how it affects others. This of course wouldn't apply to activities that have consequences to others as a natural result, but for something like an extreme sport, where the risk is simply remote, that risk isn't enough to prevent someone from doing what they want to do.\n\nDefining a scale of \"reasonableness\" for extreme sports is also a difficult endeavor, as  individuals' risk tolerances vary from person to person. I find it completely unreasonable, for example, to \"free climb\" rock faces without any sort of safety equipment, but the person doing it clearly feels differently. At the same time, I do understand the absolute rush of adrenaline such a thing might provide, and I would be lying if I said there wasn't a small part of me that wishes I had the skill or courage to try something like that. \n\nWhether a \"sport\" is too dangerous to be called as such is an interesting question. On the one hand, defining something a \"sport\" might have the effect of encouraging others to try it, even if it is manifestly and outrageously dangerous, but on the other hand, I don't know that there should be any kind of central authority on what constitutes a sport--I think that should be left to the communities that partake in it.", "path": "./logs/pilot/7358ede473584aeaade91722278bc0f0.jsonl", "prompt": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, selfishness to pursue some risky sports all depends on the participants of the sport. Yes, some sports are risky, but is there any sport that isn't? While we can go on to say extreme mountain climbing is dangerous as a sport, aren't there people who do it for fun? The truth remains that all sports have the possibilities of concussions, broken bones, or even death - even swimming. \n\nBut for this topic, let's accept that some sports are just unbelievable. Like battling a bull or hell-in-a-cage wrestling, or even any sport that involves poisonous snakes. So what can be done about that? There's something called risk evaluation. It's when the risk of a phenomenon is measured and placed against another variable. Truly, as I have said, all sports are dangerous. But if the sport has a very high risk of danger, then it shouldn't be called a sport. It should be called the survival challenge. \n\nWhy do I say this? Sports is an activity that physical exertion or a skill in which one team (or an individual) competes against another. When a person is fighting against a killer shark, that's not sport. It's a dangerous situation.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, sports such as extreme mountain climbing are really up to the end user. Risky sports that are organized are also important to consider. One avenue of sport that is fairly extreme and has death in it each year is automobile racing. Auto racing is highly publicized and poses high risk to those driving, participating, and even spectating. As with any sort of risk individuals must decide on their participation. There seem to be two differnt arguments raised in the questioning.  \nThe first question seems to be delineating between what is classified as sport and non-sport. are we talking in generalities or are we talking about organizations that have events, and official leagues (local, national etc.). Sport is defined as \"an activity involving physical\u00a0exertion\u00a0and skill in which an individual or team\u00a0competes\u00a0against another or others for entertainment.\" Determining what is and is not sport is really up to those participating in aforementioned exertion or skill. The second is asking if there should be a line drawn on if it is considered sport if risks are too high or unreasonable. In response to this question I would pose another? How do you define reasonable risk? Is it in an automobile in the Indianapolis 500, or are you in a small passenger plane flying through obstacles at high speeds in the air? Each are part of sport and pose significant risks to all involved. \nthe wrap my thoughts into one these questions are quite broad. I believe that sport is an individual choice, and those wanting to participate should consent to knowldege of risks involved in participation of such sports. Having adequeste training and practice of specific skills can mitigate higher risk, but ultimately not all.

This is probably the most important thing that students should learn in school because this is the building block that helps them learn in the future. Without this, they will be clueless as adults and will not be able to have knowledge of any of the other subjects because they lack communication skills of English.\n\nThis most important thing I have learned in school is probably understanding the different elements of English. This is basically the topic that helps people differentiate between what can be a metaphor and what can be taken seriously. Ever since learning that I learned how to use this skill to earn what I wanted. This also helped me with many of my other school subjects as it helped me understand my teachers more and also helped me with communication in school. This helped me become more of who I am when I was in school and developed what helped me succeed today.\n\nLearning this knowledge helped me in various places as an adult. As we all know, as adults we always use advanced language than children which helps us communicate better sometimes. With this knowledge, I am able to either persuade others or convince others to what I want or what I need. With this knowledge it also helps me inform others on subjects in a more sophisticated way that sound more experience and more tolerable than just stating the facts. This is also very useful to those who are younger than me because using this type of language helps them learn in a more fun way as it is less boring then just flat out stating what needs to be said.\n\nAll in all, I think that English language arts is the most important subject to be learned in school to all of its various advantages. This helps develop the language we use almost everywhere and is the building block to developing more advanced language that helps us with all of our daily and academic struggles. Language arts when used more in advanced can help you with more sophisticated language that helps you either persuade, convince, or inform other in a more fun way than just stating the facts. Imagine if there was nothing such as hyperboles or metaphors or similes. There would be a huge chunk of the language we use today that makes it fun taken out. I can imagine how intolerable people would be from this and how boring it would have to be sitting in class just learning about a topic with only the facts. Langugae arts is also the building block that helps you learn all other subjects such as math, science, and history. For instance, if you haven't taken a language arts class and you entered history class, you would have no knowledge of what your teacher or peers are talking about.

While there is no doubt importance to learning math, science, and how to write, there is another aspect of school that is important for students to learn.

When attending each class with a different person leading it means there will be a different grading scale and set of expectations.

As a result, students need to adjust how they approach each class accordingly.\n\nAdjusting to different personalities requires asking questions to clarify expectations and trying to learn verbal and non-verbal cues to learn how to best communicate.

Attending a university didn't seem so intimidating because there were ways to handle trying to be successful in so many different environments previously.\n\nHaving this knowledge has benefitted me greatly and will continue to do so in the future.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are three most important skills all students should learn in school. Basic academic skills like reading and writing, social skills, and how to be a good citizen. \n\nThe argument for teaching basic reading and writing skills may seem too obvious to be stated, but there is more nuance than is immediately clear. Many students slip past the system, getting to the later years of elementary school or even middle school without basic reading skills. Wealthier students usually come to public school with higher 'baseline' reading skills than their poorer peers with busier parents.   The answer to these problems is less complex, however. National Pre-K and free childcare programs could completely erase these problems, and already have in other developed countries.\n\nThe need for social skills is clear. From job interviews, to building friendships, to just being happy, every human needs social skills. Personally, social skills were the most important part of my schooling. I could have gotten away with being homeschooled. My mother was smart, and she was a stay at home parent for most of my life. But, I was also an only child living in a neighborhood\u00a0with few other children. An inverted only child with social anxiety to make things worse. I still have issues with social anxiety, but without that exposure to my peers from public school, I don't know how I could have overcome that anxiety enough to become a TA in college, or give guided tours during my gap year. \n\nFinally, schools should teach students how to be good citizens. I don't mean that students should be taught to follow the law, but that students should learn how to understand their system of government. They should be taught how to vote, and why it is important that they do vote. They should be taught how they cause peaceful and democratic change in their communities. \n\nIn conclusion, schools need to teach students how to succeed. And they need the basic skills of reading and writing to do so, as well as more complex abilities, like social skills and good citizenship.\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/421b053e31f74344b04dcf2c77bc60bb.jsonl", "prompt": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the most important things a student can learn in school are not specific pieces of knowledge, but rather skills they develop throughout their curricular experience. Developing skills such as time management and hard work is what will ultimately set students up for success later in life. On the other hand, remembering the exact date the American colonists defeated the British at Bunker Hill is unlikely to come in handy.\n\nSkills developed in a child's education can be used across any career and are applicable in any situation. At their job later in life, they will have due dates and timelines for when things will need to be done. This is replicated by the book reports and science fair projects they do in school. \n\nThese skills are especially important in college where students need to be able to multitask assignments from multiple classes as well as develop their independence. Having had multiple classes in high school and middle school, the ability to multitask should already be developed and be ready to help the student navigate the complicated world. This skill could even be enhanced by partaking in extracurriculars like sports or clubs, something that has become even more common these days.\n\nOn the other hand, the actual knowledge picked up in classes is seldom used. Other than English, there is no class where the things students learn are guaranteed to be used in their careers. Journalists do not need to know geometry and biologists have no need for the knowledge of European history. But, the journalist who spent hours studying geometry will be used to working hard hours to get what they want. this will undoubtedly serve them well in their career and set them apart from other journalists. The biologists who had to do homework for their European history class at the same time as their science project will be able to multitask and accomplish things later in life that they may not have been able to because they learned that skill in school.\n\nHowever, these skills are only learned by students who take school seriously and strive to earn good grades. Unfortunately, the effort applied to school cannot be measured, but the success of a student can, and for the most part students who work harder earn better grades. These better grades lead to better colleges than their counterparts which in turn leads to better and higher-paying jobs in the future.\n\nIn this way, the skills developed help students not only with their future jobs but also help them to get these future jobs and set them apart from other applicants. All things considered, I believe the most important thing that can be learned in school is skills such as time management, the ability to multitask, and hard work.

{"essay": "\nThe most important thing students should learn in school is effective written and verbal communication. The ability to use language effectively to express thoughts, feelings, ideas, instructions, needs\u2014and so on\u2014is essential across all industries and permeates almost every facet of existence. Language allows us to understand people with entirely different perspectives and circumstances and for them to understand us. This fosters social connection and closeness, builds relationships, allows for coordinated activity toward common goals, and helps negotiate between differences. If you can write or speak effectively, you can move through any number of spaces unfamilair to you and know and be known within them. Emphasizing verbal skills in secondary school is particularly important these days, as the virtual environment we live in increasingly requires the ability to communicate complex ideas across physical boundaries\u2014to give verbal instructions, speak over the phone or on camera, and connect with people from all over the world. \n\nVerbal communication has been the number one skill I learned in school, whether this means learning persuasive writing, public speaking, or foreign languages. Not only has learning how to communciate helped land me many career opportunities in the legal field and beyond, but it has also allowed to me to connect with and forge intimate bonds with the closest people in my life. Being a good communicator has helped me express my needs in romantic relationships, allowed me to process my own feelings and experiences through talk therapy, made me friendships, and facilitated countless positive career moves. When it comes to activism and civic engagement, my speaking skills have allowed me to unpack and debate important political issues with allies and opponents alike. In 2022, for example, I campaigned for Senator Catherine-Cortez Masto in Nevada, going door to door and speaking with neihbors about her record, her platform, and any concerns or questions they had. From casual chats to the most in-depth conversations, I was able to spread the word about my candidate, learn about a multiplicity of perspectives in the region, and eventually see the candidate elected to office.\n\nGoing forward, I plan to continue using my writing and speaking skills in my work life. As a freelance writer and editor, I am looking forward to helping clients achieve excellence in their written works and make a living doing so. As an educator, I intend to use my words to help developign students truly understand complex topics on a deep level. It is also important to me to offer emotional support and guidance to my students beyond the scope of academics. Through listening carefully to my kids' struggles and desires, I am able to verbally reassure them and help them process any difficult feelings getting in the way of succeeding in school. I've found that simply having an honest conversation with a young person where they feel safe to speak their mind can open up a door to mutual trust between student and teacher that improves both the students' academics and quality of life. Connection is the path to collective and individual prosperity as a society, and this connection thrives the more we can learn to talk to one another.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, schools do not just help with formal education but they have far reaching impact. The common expression \u201cDon\u2019t just pass through school but allow it pass through you\u201d cannot be for academic exploits only. It implies that there are other ways the school can help an individual. School is considered as a major agent of socialization, like religious institutions, peers, and family. These places are known for other forms of informal education, or better put, influence. They have a long-lasting way of shaping our mind, filling our thoughts, and impacting the trajectory we set our life as a whole.\u00a0\n\nExtra-curricular activities such as sports are important in building cognitive abilities and interpersonal relationships among students. Other lessons that should be learned also include learning to dress properly, not getting into fights while relating with people, joining or starting a queue when need be, properly disposing of refuse or recyclable items, and lots more.\u00a0\n\nCultural events in school like creative drawing, career day, poetry slams, city and museum tours, gallery crawls, and costume parties do not imply academics but were educative about other areas of life. As a student, I got to know about other people\u2019s manner of life, history, and\u00a0 learned to live amicably with other people irrespective of their religions, classes, races, and other cultural differences. Being a student helped me develop my leadership role with my appointment as a prefect, and belonging to social groups also helped me realise how impactful I can be to my community.\u00a0\n\nAs everyone would agree, there are several extra curricular activities that go on in the school. This begins with the school fixing a time for both students and teachers to resume activities for the day. This helped me learn punctuality - \u201cthe sole of business.\u201d Now that I always have a lot to fo, I understand what it means to rise from bed early and achieve my daily goal.\nAlso, it helps me to develop a high sense of responsibility for my present day life as a whole. Thanks to the order and rules we have in schools. Such activities may make school regimented but they have shaped my life as a whole. I have made purposeful friends who care about my growth and always help me achieve my set goals.\u00a0\nMoving forward, I have no doubt about many more benefits school would provide. As they say, \u201cthe higher you go, the cooler it becomes.\u201d This implies that, there are more lessons and personal development to learn as I proceed with my education. The major lesson I am looking forward to is managing my career and living my dream.\u00a0\nMy career is beyond making a living for me but having global impact. I want to be the best at it and provide optimum service for others. To make people\u2019s life count, I believe I am to be serious with school and get that desired best out of it.\u00a0So, the benefit from school for me is a long-life journey with great impact for my immediate environment and world at large.\n\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/2dc033241ed84c9a8f412a8db329580f.jsonl", "prompt": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion,  the most important things students should learn in school depend on the age and stage of life of the student. For example, a young children just beginning their education, I think it's probably most important to learn basic educational skills, like addition, subtraction, alphabet, basic history, etc. These are the types of foundational things that, perhaps unlike certain niche educational skills and topics that become more prevalent as students get older, will always be useful, and are critical items that allow the child to learn and understand progressively more difficult concepts.\n\nAs children get older, I think it is arguably more important for students to learn how to think, rather than learning what to think. Of course, specific lessons are always important throughout an education, but the true objective of education should be training your mind on how to acquire new information, organize that information, and seek out appropriate new information. I think this becomes especially true in college, where the education process often changes drastically from what students are used to in primary school, to a more socratic type of method of learning, where free thought and discussion is encouraged. I don't remember a whole lot from the general education philosophy courses I took in college, but I certainly remember how they challenged me to think outside the box, with a healthy skepticism toward things. Not to mention the interpersonal skills that people are really only able to learn and develop through education. From the age of about 5 to 17 or so, children are basically held hostage and forced to interact with their peers and with other adults. This is absolutely critical to the development of students as people, and hiccups during this stage of development are, in my opinion, a big reason for developmental failures in full-grown adults.\n\nI am confident that the full education I have had the opportunity to receive, from primary school, to college, to law school, has equipped me with not only an immense amount of specific knowledge, but I also feel as though I have the ability to learn anything I wish. Not to say that it would be easy--just that I feel capable of doing so if that's really what I wish to do. That is something that didn't become apparent until after law school, where ostensibly I was expected to remember and memorize a truly insane amount of information, but after finishing that experience and becoming a practicing lawyer, I am confident that the real benefit is how that experience has forever changed my way of thinking", "path": "./logs/pilot/d229e6e754b3481a8748cc206e034863.jsonl", "prompt": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school?
