{"essay": "\nAs someone who could be verifiably considered a Marvel movie connoisseur, and a movie buff, there are all kinds of characters that make me cringe on a near daily basis. I\u2019m not sure if that makes me a hypocrite or just someone with a lot of opinions, but even within Marvel, there are absolutely characters in every film that I just cannot stand. For the sake of this article, I\u2019m going to bring my list down into franchises starting with none other than Marvel Studios!\n\nThe first character within the marvel franchise that I absolutely cannot stand is none other than Iron Man himself! I know that I will undoubtedly receive a pretty hefty amount of flak for this one, but just hear me out here. Tony Stark has been characterized in just about every film throughout the years as a super genius and industrialist playboy. Despite his potential, Tony is easily one of the most boring, clich\u00e9d characters that I have ever seen within a Marvel film. Next up on the list of characters that just make me cringe, we have none other than Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy. While on paper Drax is a character I should totally love, on the screen he feels like a bumbling hick who just keeps stepping on every possible moment that he\u2019s involved with. Drax had a very limited amount of screen time in the film and while he may have served as adequate eye candy, his atrocious sense of humor  was an awful addition to the MCU. The last character (in the Marvel franchise) that makes me cringe on so many levels is Carol Danvers. While I know that Captain Marvel is going to be a game changer for the MCU and will be an extremely exciting addition to the roster, I just simply cannot stand her character. while I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do, Carol has almost zero motivations throughout all of the Marvel films and just comes off as a flat and uninteresting character, who seems like a waste of space on my screen.\n\nThe last character that I would like to discuss for this article today is going to be none other than Iceman from the Top Gun franchise. While I\u2019m going to be completely honest with you and say that I do actually like this character a lot outside of this particular issue, there is one thing about his personality  that really just drives me up the metaphorical wall. I\u2019m honestly not sure exactly what it is that I\u2019m not a fan of about this particular character, but I just don\u2019t appreciate the way that he treats other characters and how cocky he appears to be.\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/d18d7234d5da4651a987404378979950.jsonl", "prompt": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the tone and type of story the creator is looking for determines what my thought process is on a certain character or people. I can see certain characters sympathetically, like any character meant to be mean or push away from the reader. However, there are certain types of art that were created to be intentionally mean-spirited. Anything that is created purposefully to offend can be difficult to watch.\n\nThe only type of characters that make me cringe are usually people attempting to portray people of a different race. Blackface is a famous example of this, but there are many different examples of people using a stereotypical accent or changing their appearance to try and look like they are another race. When it comes to character's motivations in a story, there isn't any particular subject matter that I would avoid. Watching films or reading books about flawed characters is something I don't mind. While I enjoy \"Gran Torino\" which is a story about a racist character portrayed by Clint Eastwood, I could see why people didn't enjoy it or found it offensive. \n\nOne example of tone being important to determining if an offensive portrayal of someone bothers me is in the movie \"Blazing Saddles.\" This movie is pure comedy. Creator Mel Brooks was telling a story of bigotry in the old American West through a satirical lens. Throughout the movie, most of the characters in the movie, regardless of background, are played as buffoons or idiotic. The humor doesn't seem like it was meant to offend. \n\nMeanwhile, a film like \"Birth of a Nation\" is one that is difficult to even tolerate the thought of. The film's creator was directly trying to vilify physically African-American people in any possible way. While D.W. Griffith's film was ahead of its time technically, it contains a tone and subject matter that makes it watch even for its technical superiority at the time. It's disgusting, and I'd never recommend it.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a difference between tone and subject matter. When watching, reading or consuming art or media there needs to be a certain amount of critical thinking that goes into determining what the story is about. While story characters can be portrayed in an offensive way, it can also be important to ask why some works were created in the way they were.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I don't like the damsel in distress themes and stereotypes in movies and books. It is a stereotypical character that has played out way too much in all media types, from movies, books, and video games. The stereotype does not work in the modern world, where women have been empowered to be equal to men. It is a gross show of what we, as a society, used to view women, and it has no place in modern media.\n\nAll of the women in the James Bond movies come to mind as stereotypical dumb women who are not fleshed out and overly rely on a man to come to their rescue and rescue them from danger. It is almost like they start to flesh out the women just to show that they can but then return to the stereotypical character incapable of saving herself. Ultimately the women in the movie are nothing more than sexual objects designed to make James Bond look more like a manly man. Sadly, the people who create these movies have such a low view of women and only want to portray them as sexual objects and victims. \n\nWomen have grown up not being objects and victims and don't like to be treated that way. It is time that we step into the 21st century and start to write women as actual characters, or they will not be believable.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are some stereotypes and offensive portrayals in media that make me cringe, but I think it absolutely depends on the context such as the time period it was created and the personal views of the author/writer/creator. I think stereotypical portrayals can absolutely have their place in media if done tastefully, or respectfully. Forms of stereotypical characters that do make me cringe are the ones that are based in ignorance or bigotry, and treated with normalcy. For example, portrayals of Native Americans in films and TV in the 20th Century were usually (though not always) based on a stereotype that didn't really have any basis in fact, and portrayed them as delinquents and people who weren't really to be respected, which had a damaging effect on Native Americans at the time.\n\nHowever, an offensive portrayal of a character or a stereotype is not something that would make me not watch or read or consume that media. Like I said, I think media represents a product of its time, and so it is essential to view them through that context. For example, a character that makes racist statements, but the writer's intention is to show the character's ignorance or show that the character is wrong, in my opinion is completely acceptable. Obviously, some people may have different levels of media literacy, so they may view that character as right, or not ignorant, but that's a product of media literacy, not the character/stereotype itself.\n\nI think that over time we have seen offensive portrayals of characters and stereotypes in media lessen, in part due to the increased amount of information available with modern technology, and access to communication with different people, and in part due to a growing desire for social justice and equality. Ideally, this trend continues as society becomes increasingly inclusive and diverse, and we can get to a point where a stereotypical character or person's representation is not due to ignorance or disdain, but rather a potent and insightful plot device that can help reflect society.", "path": "./logs/pilot/4aff0f4055724ddbb177e11ab616a9cf.jsonl", "prompt": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, when races or genders are stereotype, I find it difficult to watch. Stereotypes tend to be hurtful, and generalizations of diverse groups of people are misleading at best. These stereotypes can even affect young minds who are susceptible to influence from media and other related sources. \n\nIn the case of women, the entire spectrum of female characters in books, movies and shows can actually be narrowed down to a few broad categories. There is the short-hair, often \"butch,\" female character. There is the \"femme fatale\" that was popularized in noir films. The femme fatale-type of character is the one that makes me cringe the most, mostly because it can fuel objectification. It promulgates a negative perception of female characters, especially ones who are in positions of power or influence. It suggests that women are essentially either a factor that results in men's downfall or an object of lust. \n\nIn the case of race, offensive portrayals do it the most damage because of the associated prejudice. Movies and books with stereotypically sketchy or offensive portrayals of Africans, Asians or other races allow readers to blindly cast judgment on entire groups of people. For example, there are the portrayals of Africans or blacks as not intelligent. There is the portray of Asians as mysterious and backwards. There are portrayals of American Indians or Native Americans as dim-witted savages. The list goes on and these stereotypes help to influence young minds into having preconceived biases about people.\n\nWhen these stereotypes are spread en masse to people who have no way to verify their credibility in their local environment, it can several warp a person's conceptions of the world around them. It can breed an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion. It can lead to the false construction of entire groups of peoples. It reduces the diversity present within each identity. \n\nWhile generalizations can be valuable at times, it is important to recognize when they are inaccurate and generalizations that pertain to a group of people. When a writer or filmmaker portrays huge groups of people as comically foolish, stupid or unsophisticated, they restrict the scope of readers' imagination. Not just that, they also restrict the scope of their understanding of the world.

{"essay": "\nI love stories. I am happy to take them in any format: books, movies, or tv. My favorite genres are apocalyptic fiction, supernatural stories, science fiction, and fantasy. In these genres, which grow in popularity, you come across characters who are well-written with depth, backstory, and growth and other characters who seem to have been plucked straight out of Carl Jung's list of archetypes.\n\nAs an example, my friends and I love the TV show Supernatural. The first few seasons develop depth in the main characters Dean and Sam Winchester. It slowly reveals the events that influenced their life and how they each developed differently. As the show has developed, there have been hints of backstories for many of the secondary characters as well. Castiel, Bobby, Charlie, and other secondary characters also develop backstories and depth. Their actions and desires are compelling. as they develop.\n\nHowever, in the later seasons, we start to see the characters trapped in behavioral loops. They repeat the same actions, even the same phrases. One or the other of the brothers sacrifices himself to save the world, and the other one makes desperate choices to save him.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are still many stereotypical characters in movies, books, and television, even though these stereotypes should be long gone. There are a few stereotypes which really make me cringe and get angry. The ones that affect me the most are the ones I've heard my whole life, the ones associated with race and gender. These stereotypes have long been debunked, yet many writers still rely on them for easy laughs or drama. While we are seeing more examples of strong women and people of color in movies, books, and television, there is still a reliance on helpless women and poor, uneducated people of color to provide entertainment. \n\nThe first stereotype that really gets under my skin is the helpless woman. It seems that women still need to be rescued by men in the movies, even successful women. I think that even without the rescue, women are still seen as helpless and sometimes weak. Why is it always the female character who falls down in a horror movie when the bad guy is chasing her?  Why do women still make bad decisions that cause us to yell at the tv screen? In the recent Netflix series \"The Diplomat\", Kate is an ambassador who does a great job, but she can't seem to do it without the assistance of her husband and a circle of smart men. It seems that women can't help themselves; they are smart, but they have to make bad choices or rely on men to validate their instincts. I feel that we are creating a new stereotype of incapable women, and that it is demeaning. \n\nThe second stereotype that gets to me is people of color being depicted as poor, uneducated, and violent.  This stereotype is another one that seems to be stuck. Often, a black character has to \"rise above\" his or her upbringing to be seen as a strong character. Rarely is it the other way around, where a black character is shown as successful, and his or her race doesn't seem to matter. In drama series \"Truth Be Told\", Olivia Spencer plays a successful journalist who is often at odds with her family and her past. She is portrayed as the different one; she dresses differently, she talks differently, and she moved away from her family to create a new life. It is as if she couldn't win a Pulitzer and be a part of her family. I don't understand why writers can't picture a strong successful character as a person of color without making them outsiders or \"other\".  The fact that we have to point out the exception to the stereotype only shows that the stereotype is still going strong.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, every stereotype, especially racial ones, should be viewed with a critical eye and mind. Every individual is different and unique in their way, so that is why I find it uncomfortable when a TV show makes fun of a person for being themself. The stereotypes that make me cringe the most are the damsel in distress, the dumb jock, and most importantly, any racial stereotypes. \n\nThe damsel in distress is a terrible stereotype because it basically tells women that they are not capable of being a competent person and have to rely on a man in order to get ahead in life. This type of behavior sets the progression of females back because it makes it seem like women can't do things on their own. It also limits their physical capability to do anything because they have to rely on some type of man for help. This, of course, makes me cringe because I can't stand it.\n\nAnother cringy stereotype is the dumb jock. This stereotype is a common one in just about every type of media. The dumb jock stereotype basically tells people that if you are athletic, then you have no capability to use your brain. This gives athletic people a bad reputation because it makes them seem stupid. It's even worse when people can't seem to believe that a muscular, big guy can think and have feelings just like everyone else. This stereotype can really hurt someone if they're caught in this one.\n\nFinally, the worst types of stereotypes involve any racial stereotypes. This stereotype is extremely offensive because it makes one race seem superior compared to another. This is why people cringe because it makes it seem like the race portrayed in this stereotype are superior than the others.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, no, I do not believe that it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. That question is similar to the likes of one that asks: should I care less about one wrong thing just because another wrong thing is also occurring? It sounds almost ridiculous when put that way, but is ultimately the same question being asked. Animals (and plants too) are mistreated every day just because they are not considered as important or valuable to humans. Does that mean that the mistreatment is any less important just because it's done to one species over another? If the main concern or issue here is mistreatment, I do not think caring about one thing over the other is wrong.\n\nI believe that people are more empathetic towards animals because we know that animals are basically helpless at the hands of humans. Not that this justifies the mistreatment of humans in anyway, it's probably just a subconscious thought process to inherently feel bad for something that is almost helpless at the hands of another. However, that being said, just like with humans, animals should not suffer at the hands of another for no reason.\n\nBeing compassionate towards the welfare of animals while there are humans suffering is not wrong to me because why should we have to choose one over the other? I don't think it should be a choice whether or not one should receive more compassion than the other. Regardless of who is on the receiving end of mistreatment, it is wrong and we should be compassionate regardless. \n\nAlso, there are other things that are taken into consideration when people think about feeling bad for others in certain situations. It's never a \"one side to the story\" when it comes to mistreatment. People are always quick to question, \"Well, what was done to deserve that mistreatment?\" or \"There are always two sides to a story\" and so I also feel like that contributes to why people are less inclined to feel bad for others that are being mistreated.\n\nOn the other hand, when animals are on the receiving end of mistreatment by people, we never question what the animal could have done to cause their mistreatment. We do not see animals as our equals, but as inferior and helpless in comparison to us and so any mistreatment towards animals is just out of pure malice. Once again, not to justify the mistreatment of humans over animals, but that is likely the thought process behind why statistics show that humans are more inclined to care about harming animals over other humans.\n\nI think that rather than focusing on whether or not we should care about one's mistreatment over the other, we should be focusing on how to stop mistreatment altogether or just being compassionate towards any living thing. The one thing both humans and animals share is that they are living things and with that should come the understanding that all living things are deserving of the same respect and the same treatment. Just because you, as an individual, views one species lesser than the other, does not mean one life is more valuable than another. In light of that fact, I think focusing on animal welfare when humans are suffering is not wrong at all because animals deserve compassion and respect too. \n", "path": "./logs/pilot/4536242c14434012b1a00aae7c880458.jsonl", "prompt": "Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, people are more empathetic for the suffering of animals over people due to the fact that they don't have a voice to stand up for themselves.  A puppy being kicked on the street will bring more empathy than an adult being injured because we know that the animal can not defend itself.   If a child is abused, people also are more likely to help because of the the defense aspect.  I don't think it is a people versus animal issue, but more so the defenseless piece.  As humans, we are better equipped to speak up for and defend others.\n\nI think this also comes down to the situation and the bystander.  For example, if I were to see a woman being hit in the street by someone I would stand up for her.  However, if I see a drunk guy at a bar starting issues and then getting hit I would be less likely to step in.  When it comes to children, animals, and someone with special needs I think there is a completely different view on how to handle the situation.  I believe that it is important to understand empathy and why humans are able to empathize in different situations but knowing your limits on what you can do to help or when you should.\n\nThere is a television show that addresses these exact issues titled \"What Would You Do?\"  Within the show, people are placed in situations as bystanders to see how they would react.  This show not only illustrates the empathy we have for these situations, but it also shows us what is important to actually help in a situation.  The amount of times that people simply walk by someone being bullied or verbally abused without stepping in when it is an adult is saddening.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, focusing on animal welfare when humans are suffering is not wrong. It is moral to try and care for all life, not just humans. No matter how hard we try to combat plague, famine, or other obstacles, human suffering will always exist.

Also, if we neglect to focus on animal welfare, it would be highly immoral to become so morally hollow that we apply our morality only to humans.

Thus we must focus on their well-being as much as it is possible.\n\nThere is a reason why humans care for other animals, especially our pets, sometimes more than other humans. Humans are intelligent and undoubtfully the apex species on Earth. Though we may dominate the Earth, humans are selfish, cruel, and too often not enjoyable to be around. On the other hand, a dog is full of love; they're innocent and pure. We feel sorrow when we see such an innocent creature dying. We often feel that animals deserve to live more than humans do. There is a reason why serial killers often kill animals to begin their murderous rampage.\n\nHumans are responsible for safeguarding all the life on Earth, not just ourselves. Being the most intelligent creatures on Earth has given us the responsibility to ensure that life continues and is not destroyed by our endeavors. Throughout our history, and more so during the industrial revolution, we have been a devastating force on nature. It has been a growing sentiment throughout the globe that we must use our intelligence to safeguard all life.\n\nIn conclusion, though there is great human suffering in the world, it is still important that we pay attention to the suffering of animals as well.

People see animals as less able to care for themselves. Often, this care for animals is placed on domesticated animals. When we place this human need to care on wild animals, we are  interfering with the animals' harmonious relationship with nature. \nPeople may feel less empathetic and less likely to help other people due to fear. We often fear the unknown. We do not always understand why people do what they do, and it is easier to make assumptions about them than to get to know them. People may assume that the homeless person on the street is a drug user or an alcoholic. They don't want to help a person when they believe their money would be wasted. Another snap judgement people may make about the homeless is that they're lazy and don't want to work. When in actuality, they no longer have the resources to get a job. For example, how would a homeless person get clean clothes, a hair cut, a shower, a resume, etc, to apply for a job, complete an interview, and remain clean and presentable for that job every day. This is a real barrier to mainstream living, not laziness.\nFinally, people as a whole are not as empathetic toward other people because they believe that other people might harm them. When people are more empathetic toward animals, they have the mindset that all animals are 'good.' However, as humans we are aware that there are dangerous people. We look with suspicion at the other people around us and wonder: Is this guy following me to tell me I dropped something or to kidnap me?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, this is an exceptionally controversial topic. When taken in the correct context, it's not surprising to see that forty percent of people would choose to save an animal over a human. I believe this is because humans are extremely violent, disgusting, and unempathetic towards other humans in everyday life. It's not often that you hear stories of kind people saving other people from their terrible situations. The culture we live in today is selfish and greedy, and this is reflected in people every day. \n\nAnimals, unlike humans, are pure by nature. They are not poisoned by greed or other consummated thoughts. Animals live to survive, often taking only what they need and nothing more. Many species live in packs or hoards, supporting each other. I believe the reason humans are more empathetic towards others is because of their purity. But it's also important to remember that animals also cannot speak up for themselves and many cannot defend themselves. Humans can do both of these things. Humans are capable of so much more than animals, including understanding times where they don't belong and taking action to end oppression.\n\nI fully believe in helping my neighbor without the expectation of appreciation or the expectation that it's somehow going to change them. I hope that my good actions inspire others, but I know it will take more than just myself doing something to make an impact. However, I will always put my animals and others first. Humans have destroyed their homes, food sources, and way of life for the sake of greed and power. Not enough humans stop to think about the animals in danger long enough to think whether this new outlet mall or housing development is harming the environment or animals in their natural habitat.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are also suffering. However, I do think it could be considered a morally gray area. But, I think overall it is never wrong to focus on a problem just because there is another problem considered bigger present. Even though there are bigger problems than animal abuse, it is never wrong to tackle the smaller ones.\n\nIt does not surprise me in the least that a study found that research subjects were more upset about stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult who was similarly beaten. This does not surprise me because dogs have inherent innocence. There is no world in which a dog deserves to be beaten by a baseball bat unless it has rabies or is attacking someone or someone else's dog. But even then, humans should be blamed for not giving the dog a proper rabies immunization or training it correctly.\n\nOn the other hand, a human likely did something to provoke their attacker.    People do not go around beating people with a baseball bat because they just feel like it, for the most part. I would be willing to bet, however, that if the human was totally innocent and video was shown of both incidents, the research subjects would be equally upset over each incident.\n\nIt also does not surprise me that 40% of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist. This is because most people have forged a strong, unique connection with their dog while they have absolutely no connection with a foreign tourist. It also interests me that they included that the tourist was foreign. I believe this could have been done so that the subjects would have absolutely nothing in common with the human individual, while the person knows their dog incredibly well.  It likely would have been included in this study to intentionally raise the probability of choice for the dog.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I believe people can be more empathetic towards animal suffering than human suffering because animals have inherent innocence. While there are humans suffering despite having total innocence, understanding their issues would require research.   There are also likely many other factors involved in their pain, making the study more complex. On the other hand, a person seeing a dog being beaten would immediately know something is wrong with no research necessary.\n\nIt is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when there are humans suffering. There should also be a concern and more resources put towards the end of human suffering, but there is not a problem with some individuals finding themselves more focused on animal suffering.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the most important thing a student should learn in school is the ability to adapt. When students leave the protective environment of school, they are often confronted with a different style of living and have to adjust to it. No one knows what life is going to throw in their way. An individual might be in college learning finance, and then once they graduate, they can not find a job in their field. Instead then sitting there, getting frustrated that they can not find a job in their field, they can pivot and find another job. Being adaptable is crucial to succeeding in life.\n\nIt's difficult to say what was the most important thing I've learned in school because everything helped me learn something. The most important thing I learned was not the information in school but the skills I gained because of school. It might seem weird that the most helpful thing to learn in school is not explicitly taught. Classroom information is not the most helpful thing students take with them. Sometimes the experience of going through school helps students learn the skill to adapt.\n\nBeing adaptable has been extremely beneficial to me in a lot of ways. For instance, I studied political science, philosophy, and college, but those were not the fields I pursued once I graduated. I did initially, but once I couldn't find a job in those fields, I decided to pivot. I started to learn copywriting and other freelance writing skills.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is critical thinking. The information taught in schools will (likely) always remain accessible, but the critical thinking and comprehension skills needed for higher levels of learning and in the \"real world\" are universally beneficial. So I think it should be the focus and priority of our education system to emphasize methods of learning that build critical thinking skills, as opposed to simply memorizing the right answer or knowing all of the facts. Personally, I can't remember half of the things I was taught in school to the extent that I would pass the tests and quizzes on the specifics, but throughout my educational career I learned how to think critically, how to absorb information and come to conclusions, and how to question and apply what I've learned. This, in my opinion, is the greatest advantage of a long and involved education, and the most important thing I've learned as a student. \n\nAlthough I am still a college student, so I'm still in the process of building my critical thinking skills, I've been able to apply them to my everyday life, as well as to my studies. In situations where I must deal with conflicting information, I can think critically and analyze the information to arrive at an accurate conclusion that fits with the facts, which is increasingly beneficial in a world where information and misinformation are nearly equally prevalent. Critical thinking also allows you to better empathize and understand your surroundings in your personal life, which I've found beneficial when dealing with relationships and colleagues, where it may at times not be possible to understand everyone's perspective. In my opinion, the critical thinking skills I developed throughout my educational career have had a positive impact on my life thus far, and will hopefully continue to make me more successful for years to come.\n\nI think that everyone is able to build critical thinking skills, and it is never too late to begin. I consistently apply my critical thinking skills in my educational, at the college level it is a necessity, but also through the work I do and my everyday life choices. I think that building these critical thinking skills eventually gets you to a point where you almost don't need to actively apply them, it becomes a habit to always think of the other viewpoints and perspectives, to always consider the other options, or to find the third option between two seemingly opposing ideas. This is beneficial regardless of what your educational field is, your career, or who are what you interact with on a daily basis. Ultimately, I think schools should primarily aim to teach students to build their critical thinking skills, to be able to think for themselves, as opposed to simply retaining information and knowing the right answer. It is more important to know how to reach the right answer, than simply knowing the right answer, and that should be the real priority of our education system.", "path": "./logs/pilot/55f965c20d864d709d093a22cf91d15e.jsonl", "prompt": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, one of the most important fundamental things we need to learn in school is proper English grammar. In a dramatic demonstration of the logical skill of proof by contradiction, I will now write the remainder of this essay's body in complete bullshit English to prove my point. \n\nIt is an iterative process. The telltale creak of its wheel is in the air of every curve and sweep: each shape it traces, its lineaments traced before. Look! Observe it! It is me! And to look only at what is there, to seek neither above nor below, is to enter the storehouse of your own eyes. You are the student.

No. Let us now consider the salient points addressing the question above, and explore via a more conventional proof the value of a good grammatical education. \n\nPeter Kropotkin pointed out one hundred years ago in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution that language which is used communicatively among humans - before all else for its social value - is based on a precise syntax and grammar. Therefore, one might expect that a formal basis would aid in communicating clearly. However, relativist beliefs and their pernicious assumptions (in fact, popular relativism is only a product of The Enlightenment) that syntax and grammar are ultimately \"a matter of perspective\" - implying that all languages are equal - have hurt the learning process by allowing the impression that grammar is arbitrary and futile; these beliefs have no basis in fact. Indeed, schools of education teach relativist theories about language, as if grammar were a piece of cake for anyone who had decided to speak English and must only learn it on an intuitive level. However, in their ignorance of the requirements of communicativity and its potential to damage students' prospects for success, ideologues have adopted an approach based on consumerist, postmodernist notions of language that are contradicted by observation and proven theorems.\n\nThe radical linguists and their neo-Marxist followers think it is possible to invent a language from scratch. Poppycock! This is not only an impossible task, but requires a distorting reverence for irrationality and ancient customs. The reason we continue to teach English grammar in schools is that it is absolutely essential. It is not only the most important thing students should learn, but it is among the most important things that anyone can learn.

However, I also see that as students get older they are taught to regurgitate facts rather than learn skills. Students need to learn how to read and write, they need to learn how to complete basic math skills, and they need to be able to hypothesize what will happen through science.  And, while I do think they need to know the past not to repeat it, I also think they should be looking at why things happened within history rather than  just the facts and timelines. \nI believe schools need to start teaching more career awareness programs.  Realistically, every student will not attend college whether that be due to financial hardship or lack of interest.  However, we need to emphasize the importance of trade schools.  Being able to do electrical, carpentry, and masonry are skills that will be needed in the future. When  I was in school, we were pushed on how college was essentially the only option.  Student loans wouldn't matter because a degree gets you a higher paying job.  Now I see businesses looking for skilled workers rather than college grads.\nIn school, I learned my passion.  I learned about how much I enjoyed jumping into  a good book and sharing my opinions and views through writing.  This helped guide me towards becoming a teacher who gets to share that with students.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are English, Math, and Science. Although all subject areas have benefits in their own ways, these are the areas that I think are important.  These subjects are useful because people use them on a daily basis, they are the foundation for many other subjects, and they can help students to get jobs in the future.\n\nI believe that English is an important subject to learn because it is a basic skill that many people need on a daily basis. It is helpful to be able to use good communication skills while writing letters, reports, and narrative pieces. This is also a skill required for many other subjects. It can help with writing test answers, which are also an important part of school. It is also necessary in order to read a text book or answer a question. Ultimately English might be the most important school subject. \n\nAnother noteworthy school subject is math. Everyone has heard \"math helps you do everyday tasks easier\" and this is true. Every action we do is based on numbers. It is essential to know how to count in order to buy food, write a check, or pay the correct amount of money. It is essential to know how to do simple operations such as addition and subtraction in order to understand addition problems and subtraction larger numbers. Math is an important concept that students should learn. \n\nScience is a crucial topic as well. If they don't, they will have more of a hard time understanding how things are. It is essential to know how the world functions in order to understand why we have things like seasons, why it's cold in some places but hot in others. It is essential to understand how elements work in order to understand the world around us. Science is a useful element and it is very important to learn for everyone. Once the students understand these concepts, they will be able to apply what they have learned in the real world. \n\nI believe that English, Math, and Science are the most important subjects for a person to learn. While recognizing the value of all subject areas, I believe these three play a pivotal role. These subjects possess practical relevance as they are applicable in our daily lives, enabling effective communication, problem-solving, and scientific understanding. Furthermore, they serve as the cornerstone for numerous other disciplines, forming a strong foundation for academic pursuits.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the most important thing a student learns in school is the ability to think critically. Although there are many other lessons to be learned such as communication skills, reading skills and so on, the most important thing a student can learn is the confidence to question what they are being told. \n\nEvery day, a person receives tons of information from the media, their teachers, and other authority figures. Children and teens especially are met with a huge amount of new information each day via social media. It is very easy to construct a false narrative on social media. Empowering students to become critical thinkers gives them the tools and confidence to discern fact from fiction. \n\nLearning critical thinking skills has allowed me to understand and connect with media, whether it be news, television, or films - on a deeper level. This is not only fun for someone like me, who likes to think about and study these things. But, I feel I can get more information from these outlets by forming my own opinions based on the information it gives me. \n\nLooking deeper at each other and the world allows us to connect to one another as individuals as well. Allowing a student the space to practice questioning things, looking deeper than what is given to them at face value, and applying what they learn to their lives allows them to grow as human beings. I believe that critical thinking skills coupled with empathy for one's fellow human beings makes for a more successful and fulfilled citizen of the world.\n\nHaving these skills will help me succeed in the future by giving me the authority to make my own decisions and ascertain facts from fiction. Through thinking critically about what I am being told, I know that I have control over my choices and opinions on the matter.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, college athletes are an integral part of the game and should be given a stipend for spending their time practicing, playing, and attending team events. Compensation is the least encouragement you can provide for a student that does and offers a lot. They have their academics at risk and still give their all to practice, commit their best in the games, and attend events. Based on experience, the school sporting activities take a large chunk of their lives and they can hardly have interest in other matters. \n\nStipends does not mean payment like a professional athlete. However, some of their basic needs can be catered for, after all the school can make a lot of money and grow in recognition because of these students' spirit of heroism. So, providing them a little bucks for their school books, general upkeep, or to cater for their parents will mean a lot for these children. Also, it will encourage them to commit their all as they have just been rewarded - \"To whom much is given, much is expected.\" \n\nMcDavis may be right when he said that paying players would have a decimating effect on the game. Students may forget that their primary assignment is as students, they may think they are sportsmen first. As such, they can become carried away and not focus on their academics. Some may focus still but give more priority to sport since some bucks are made from it. \n\nThe solution to this is order. There can be a grade benchmark for these sport athletes and only those who do well in their academics and sport responsibility should be paid. Once students move up a level or focus more on sport than academics, they should be brought down to the primary level. Let me tell you more. \n\nThere is a movie by Samuel L. Jackson where he played as a Team Coach for college kids. The Title of the movie is Coach Carter. He ensured that the students committed their all in both sports and academics. There was a particular benchmark for their academics and only those who meet it are in his good books. \n\nOf course, this may seem like extra work but it is worth it, after all this is what they are supposed to do. You are giving them a sense of responsibility that they can excel at two different worlds without one affecting the other. That is what education is about. Coach Carter worked hand-in-hand with the teachers to ensure the student athletes are faithful with their class attendance, assignments while giving all in training. \n\nSo, excelling in academics and being excellent at sport deserves some stipend. It is a reward and even a way to encourage them in doing more towards their schooling. You may have to let them know that it is a privilege and if taken out of place, such can be withdrawn at any time. This will help them not have any sense of entitlement to such stipend.

I honestly don't know what the answer is, but I believe it is somewhere between what it is now and paying student athletes. \n\nI see the drawbacks of paying student athletes and what it would do to, not only sports, but to the system for attracting student athletes to a university. Many fans of college sports complain that it sullies the purity of the sport. They think paying the athletes dilutes that and makes them no different from professional athletes. In this sense, I find McDavis' argument persuasive. If universities introduced payment, then they're no different from pros. So, perhaps paying them isn't the right path forward? \n\nLook, I understand their position and see where they are right, but I am not one of those people that believe student athletes should get nothing. They put an incredible amount of work into promoting the university and make it millions of dollars. They need something, some guarantee that if they get hurt, especially permanently, they won't be penalized by being pushed to the side and forgotten. \n\nThough this might be extreme, I think that if a student athlete is picked up by a school then there must be a guarantee to a full scholarship that begins before they walk on the field or court. Such that if they get injured it can't be taken away from. Even if they only play one game. Even if they get injured on the first day of practice their freshman year \u2013 that full ride is theirs until they graduate or drop out. In addition to a guaranteed full academic career in case of injury, I think other expenses should be paid or heavily subsidized: room and board, a meal plan, and full healthcare. \n\nConsidering the boats loads of cash they make for universities, maybe some kind of pay out based on performance could be worked out \u2013 starting with a smaller amount that goes to athletes who don't make it the full 4 years or get injured at some point \u2013 all the way down to the kid who gets injured on the first day of practice and can't play anymore. Even she or he should get something. Maybe a stipend or something would make sense \u2013 just for being part of the team.\n\nAside from the above, I don't think there should be any limit of what a student athlete makes from endorsements. They are at this stage of their lives adults who are engaging in business relationships based on their talent, skill, and even social media presences. This also goes for marketing that uses their likeness. \n\nIn conclusion, I'm on the fence about giving student athletes an actual (big) salary, but that' where my agreement with traditional college sports lovers ends.

{"essay": "\nCollege athletes should unequivocally be paid; the failure to do so is systemic oppression, discrimination, greed, and exploitation. McDavis's argument is not persuasive. College athletes at the highest level are already akin to professional stars and the surrounding community already knows this. Colleges already do everything they can to attract top talent, and the competitive schools who would be engaged in such a \"bidding war\" are already those schools with the money to do so. The argument that college athletes should not be paid in our current system is ridiculous. College football and basketball are like the X Games; playing Division I is already akin to professional athletics. The amount of money student-athletes generate for universities is unquantifiable and the fact that students see none of it beyond unethical. How can college football make nearly $1 billion in revenue and have majority of its tens of thousands of participants receive no monetary compensation?\n\nAs it currently stands, student-athletes are exploited by a system in which they serve as nothing more than human capital to generate profit. McDavis's argument creates a strawman about what paying NCAA players would entail for \"the broader community\" despite the fact that he ignores countless examples that already occur throughout Division I athletics and in the NBA, NFL, and MLB. His reference to a supposed \"bidding war\" is hypothetical at best. There is nothing to say colleges cannot pay all athletes the same base rate in acknowledgment of their services. This method would cause no harm to the student body and could provide benefits in the form of additional healthcare for athletes and higher-quality facilities. The world of college sports left rallying cries of \"commitment to amateurism\" behind when they allowed themselves to become enmeshed in an entertainment industry worth billions of dollars. \n\nThe fact that college sports is one select field where low-income Black and brown students can break into elite institutions is no coincidence. Refusing to pay these individuals for their hours and hours of free labor is a form of exclusion that every student-athlete should stand against. College athletes are providing an essential service to the colleges they play for\u2014I guarantee you more students choose to attend D1 schools for their top basketball players than professors. Money should be flowing through these institutions, and the athletes who bring that profit should not be excluded. The alternative to refusing to pay student-athletes is refusing to profit from them. When colleges begin to take their players' mental and physical health, academics, and financial security as seriously as they do their athletic talent, then I will believe that this argument is actually about student welfare and value. Until then, we know that their attempts to cover up blatant exploitation with bogus arguments of amateurism are just that: a shallow attempt to avoid paying the athletes money that would not exist but for their incredible contributions", "path": "./logs/pilot/b7d79973fab74946ba1b36e51d4f5b5a.jsonl", "prompt": "Should College Athletes Be Paid?\n\nDo you think college athletes should be paid?

{"essay": "I don't have a ton of experience or background knowledge in this field, but my intuitive reaction is that yes--college athletes should be paid. I find the current situation in which a large number of young people are risking their physical health and cognitive abilities for little or no financial compensation disturbing. Touting the benefits of \"the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans\" sounds like exactly the kind of thing that would be said by someone who doesn't want to be forced to part with any of their own money. \n\nI think what this all comes down to is that there is 100% money being made in this situation. It's not as though the entire industry is non-profit, and now there are those advocating for injecting money into the process. I don't know the specific numbers, but there is an absolutely huge amount of money associated with college athletics. Merchandising, video games, live game attendance, etc. brings in millions of dollars for...someone. I don't know who exactly is making the money, but what is clear is that it is not the students. I have not yet heard any articulated arguments for why it would be bad idea to pay students for their contributions in this field other than nebulous arguments like \"it would hurt the broader community.\" If that is the case, then the community itself needs to be changed. If the existing infrastructure would crumble, or if, as McDavis writes, paying athletes would result in a handful of big sports programs dominating (isn't that already how it is?), then the system itself needs to be changed. Create a different system for compensating the athletes, for example. The bottom line is that the current system is just not fair. As noted, there are millions of dollars being made on the backs of these kids, and there is no reason they should not be able to reap the benefits of their backbreaking work.\n\nThe only other alternative, in my eyes, would be to remove money from the situation altogether. If the sanctity of college athletics is at such a risk if we decide to pay the athletes, then nobody should make money off of it. Prevent the use of likenesses for intellectual property, advertising, or video games. Find a way to make sports games more of a non-profit situation. There are methods; I am just confident that the reason they aren't employed is because the people currently making money off the system have no interest in changing it. They seem to like how it works, and frankly I can't say that I blame them, but it's gotten to the point that it's absurd to line the pockets of these executives and businesspeople while also having to listen to them justify the lack of compensation to extremely talented young people who are putting their health at risk.

It seems backward to me that a university might have a far higher allocated budget for its sports teams than its physics or mathematics departments. \n\nThe difference in budget or emphasis on sports programs in schools should always ride secondary to the promise of an education that can lead to a student's future success in their chosen field beyond what their bodies can withstand on the gridiron. Certainly, a big part of the problem is the fever pitch that sports seem to evoke in sports fans everywhere. So I think the problem with the emphasis is systemic.

While some may argue that certain sports are too dangerous to be called a sport, it is ultimately up to the Indvidual to make the decision for themselves. \n\n   There have been many instances of athletes competing in sports for the thrill and excitement and seemingly ignoring the risks that accompany these activities. Firstly, it is essential to understand that risk is inherent in all sports. From football to basketball, there is always a possibility of injury, ranging from minor scrapes and bruises to more sever broken bones or even death. However, its crucial to distinguish between inherent risks and unnecessary risks. For example, sports such as football and rugby have inherent risks but these risks can be minimized with proper training and equipment. In contrast, extreme sports such as base jumping involve unnecessary risks that can't be mitigated. According to Extreme Sports and Places Researchers, \"Return rate is estimated to be 20.2% in the first 3 years of practice [for extreme winter.\n  Secondly, the line between what is reasonable and what isn't is subjective and varies from person to person. Some individuals may be willing to take on greater risks for the thrill of extreme sports while others may prefer more traditional, lower-risk activities. Therefore, its essential to respect individual choices and allow people to make their own decision about their participation in sports. It's not up to anyone else to decide what is too dangerous or not. If a person is willing to accept the inherent and unnecessary risks, they are free to make that decision.\n  Moreover, many extreme sports have strict rules and guidelines in place to ensure that the risk are minimized. Governing bodies of various sports often establish and regulations that aim to minimize risks and protect athletes. For example, helmeted are mandatory in many contact sports to reduce the risk of head injuries. These guidelines ensure that the sports remain safe and enjoyable for those who participate in them. \nThe introduction of helmets in the National Football League was attributable to a number of significant injuries and increased pressure from organizations like Sports Legacy Institute (ML\n   In conclusion, extreme sports are undeniably dangerous, but that does not mean that they are too dangerous to be considered a sport.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there can be no sport which is \"too dangerous\" to be called a sport. With that said, there are varying degrees of risk which make certain sports more dangerous than others. Extreme mountain climbing, in particular, would certainly qualify as a \"dangerous\" sport. But is climbing a mountain necessarily more dangerous or extreme than such sports as motocross or bull riding? If we are to make the claim that dangerous sports ought to be avoided at all costs, we would not be living in a fully human world. Indeed, I believe that the only upper constraint on the dangerousness of a sport is its participants' collective desire to engage in them. And although we certainly should not encourage a sport to become more risky than it needs to be or can be within reason, we have no ultimate authority to single out any given athletic activity as \"too dangerous.\" Ultimately, whether some sports are \"too dangerous\" in the sense that they are not worth the risks involved, is dependent on the perspective of the athletes. \n\nAs long as there are bold and intrepid individuals who desire to compete at certain dangerous things, there should be no bound to the extreme nature of athletics. Such sports as MMA fighting also may be dangerous, but serve an important service by allowing us to better understand the limits of our bodies and human nature. Granted, we should not allow sports to become more dangerous than they need to be. For example, if the incidence of concussions in rugby were to rise by 200% in a season, we should surely want to investigate this occurrence and see what could be done to make things a bit safer. But, it is inappropriate and paternalistic for anyone to make a claim about which sports are \"too dangerous\" for any particular person to participate in. As long as there are bold and intrepid individuals competing in them, I think that the risks of any sport should be considered acceptable.

In principle, risk is part of the whole adventure sports thing. \n\nOf course, nothing in the world happens in a vacuum. Their actions affect their loved ones, others in the area and also the facilitators of these sports. For example, if someone is needlessly risking themselves leaving their family very stressed out about how they might return, then this could be considered as selfish. If they are at an organized cliff diving experience and they ignore the instructions of the facilitators and get hurt, this is also selfish. In these cases, their actions are indirectly affecting others and they are selfish because they are not being considerate to these feelings. \n\nHow are these sports different from say baseball or soccer? There is a risk in both of them but in the latter the degree of risk is determined by the participants themselves and the intensity of the competition between them. The sport itself is not inherently dangerous. But the choice to play one sport over the other is a free will decision. Some just need that element of risk involved to get any enjoyment out of sports.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, this topic depends on the circumstances of the person pursuing the sport. For example, if one is single and enjoys the thrill of pushing themself to their physical limits, I think that is acceptable. I have a brother-in-law who has spent years as a mountain climber. It began as a social activity and a way to challenge himself and his wife to push their physical limits. Both were in the military and enjoyed this sport together. When their marriage ended, he became more relentless in his pursuit of climbing higher mountains which also involved more risk.  He's a healthy guy and left the military for a career that allowed him the time to do this and paid well, so he had the means to pursue this sport. He could afford to fall and break a bone or two, so that's not something he would be concerned about. However, he also had three siblings, grandparents, and eventually a parent and stepparent all facing financial difficulties for years, which he seemed blind to. I know that he has a good heart, and has helped people financially when they asked. But I  wish he had spared his family from some of the disillusionment and anger I know they felt when he failed to offer support without being asked while spending a vast amount of money flying around the world with friends to pursue a sport that is expensive and dangerous. \n\nLet's talk about the dangerous part. I think of myself as a pretty aggressive person. Not so much in personality and with people, but in taking risks. I don't mind taking risks. But a risk needs to be calculated. And, there are risks I won't take now that I have people who depend on me. I think that this brother-in-law takes risks that are not always calculated. And, he also doesn't take into consideration how the people who love him feel. About 7 years ago, he set out to climb Mt. Everest. There was a lot of training for this climb. A lot of time and money were put into it. I was curious about how much, so I did some research. I was shocked to learn that the cost alone for one climber was about $30,000 for several months of intense training and gear purchases. Then there was the flight to Nepal, equipment purchases and fees with locals, several Sherpa guides, etc. He documented the process and posted it for the entire family to view as well as anyone else who was interested. His girlfriend kept his updates coming while he was in Nepal and during the climb. He had family who was worried about this venture. He knew that but didn't seem concerned.  I remember his mother telling me one night, that she had seen a movie about climbers and was so upset by the dangers portrayed that she did some research. She was startled to learn that many people are seriously injured and many who die trying to climb this mountain. I didn't have the heart to tell her that much of the time, a rescue mission is too dangerous to undertake, and injured climbers are left there to die since more people would likely die attempting a rescue. Or, that retrieving the bodies of the dead is near impossible, and their bodies are there still, and often used as landmarks for other climbers. \n\nThere are numerous articles and books that discuss the psychology of why people feel so compelled to take such risks. I think that with some, it's just a need to prove to themselves, and maybe some others that they are \"enough.\" In the case of my brother-in-law, it very nearly cost him his life. It was a grueling climb, and many of the people he was with were injured in weather-related accidents. \nHe began to experience pain, and trouble breathing midway. He took an extra day to rest. The next day, he went higher and experienced more trouble with rest and breathing. His sherpa told him they needed to turn back. The sherpas assist with the equipment and protection of the climber. In characteristic fashion, he didn't listen to the advice because admitting he might NOT be right was too big a risk for him. He informed the sherpa that he would be fine and just needed a little more time to recover. He kept going. He had to turn back feet from the summit.  \n\nWhen he reached the base, by helicopter, the doctors told him that another 10 minutes would have cost him his life.

Movements are not conjured up out of thin air. Informed individuals who see the need for change, for reform, have allowed for some of the greatest and most revolutionizing movements. By staying informed, we allow ourselves to be aware of the things that are done against us, that might be inherently wrong, and as long as people stay informed, we can ensure that those things are stopped in their tracks. The more people are informed, the more we can stop the things that will do more harm than good to our society. Imagine a world where no one knew what was going on around them except for a handful of world leaders? What would the world look like? There's always room for human error and leaving decisions up to a handful of individuals where the rest of us stay uninformed allows for us to be taken advantage of.\n\nInformed decisions help us progress as a society.

Personally, I believe that everyone should have some current events literacy, especially as it applies to local and national events.

Without a firm grasp of what's going on it literally is easier for others to manipulate you with mis and dis information. \n\nAt the very least, certain facets of the news should be important to consume for even the layperson, like knowing how your voting district works as a political entity, or knowing who the candidates are in an upcoming election and what they stand for. Without even this basic knowledge, you're potentially putting inept and/or dangerous people in charge of your rights and tax dollars. \n\nDoes this extend to everyone being informed on international news and events? I honestly don't know. I think society is better off when people are more informed and have a grasp of some international news stories. It helps shape your mind, your thoughts and opinions, and even influences how your participate in being a citizen at home. \n\nI think we're seeing some of this culture manifest as a whole as a politically divided nation, with fringe groups that feel so strongly for or against certain issues because they were previously deeply uninformed people who have been taken in by fake news and narrative messaging. There were vast swathes of people who never read the news who now turn to known fake news sites, conspiracy sites, and grossly biased news sites to be informed. The problem is that they didn't have good news literacy before and now their credulity has turned them into believers of some very wild and socioculturally dangerous ideologies and whitewashed history. \n\nSimply look no further than how the right and left view January 6, 2021. We literally have one political party that is divided by people who believe the 2020 election was stolen versus people in their own party who say it's not. Across the political spectrum people are still fighting about that election, and the president who likely facilitated and helped organize a riot at the US Capitol is running again for president. And he has millions of people who've been sucked in by conspiracy theories and fake news still supporting him. \n\nThat said, I also don't think there's a requirement that everyone be glued to the news, or even necessarily understand all of it.

As a child growing up in the 80s, I can distinctly remember watching my grandfather watching the news. Mind you, and this was years and years before news outlets like CNN, BBC, MSNBC, and the like. I can remember hearing my folks talking about Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, the 1984 Olympics, Chornobyl, and Haley's Comet, to cite a few topics. And I can tell you, as a kid, I couldn't see how any of that stuff really mattered. What's more, I couldn't see how any of it affected me. Of course, the reality is, in some way or another, all of these things had at least some effect, whether I realized it or not. As time went by and through my formative years, I recall events like the Berlin Wall finally being taken down and the gulf war, and treaties banning nuclear proliferation. I began paying a little bit more attention myself.  Later, when 9/11 happened, I can remember right where I was. I have heard similar sentiments from people recounting the Kennedy assassination. Those events affected me to some degree or another, as well as millions of people worldwide. Arguably 9/11 was a real turning point for me regarding how much credence I gave to current events in general.\n\nToday, although I do not \"watch\" television all that much, I do take in a fair amount of what is going on both locally and abroad. Like most people, I see, hear, and read the things that seem to be important and that seem relevant. Of course, in the age of targeted ads, we will likely see more and more of what we look at. As a result, I actually believe that it is easier for those with cell phones, laptops, tablets, and televisions to collect a fairly reasonable idea of what is going on, even if it is through a biased lens. One of the bigger problems that I see is that we live in a sensationalized society where we become desensitized to many current events that are still news. Even if most folks aren't watching what is happening in Ukraine, the war wages on, and people are dying daily, the spin machine has moved on to something new. I feel that this is unfortunate. \n\nRegardless of the fallibility of our media and the short attention span of the American public as a whole, we all have a responsibility to keep up with what is going on in our local, regional, national, and global communities.

{"essay": "\nKeeping up with the news is a part of being a good citizen. I believe that you shouldn't be allowed to complain if you don't participate in civic matters. Of course, the most significant way to participate is to vote, but reading the news and staying informed on important issues is also essential. One difficulty that people run into when they keep up with the news locally and globally, is due to finding information online. It is easy to find a multitude of articles on any topic you are interested in. However, web browsers have algorithms that search out articles you are more likely to agree with. To truly read the news, you should be reading articles that present multiple perspectives. Another problem that people have with reading the news is that they can feel anxiety when they internalize too much of the negative news. Reading too much about an incident like the COVID pandemic or the war un Ukraine can cause a person to feel anxious and helpless\n\nIn addition to reading articles from a range of sources, it is also important to read outside your personal niche or \"filter bubble.\" We all have a responsibility to understand what is happening in the world. If we understand the issues, we have the ability to do things differently in the future. Keeping up with current events keeps you connected and knowledgeable about issues that affect you personally. When I taught school, I had students analyze a current event article each week. Sometimes I gave them the article, and other times I let them choose. They learned that there were broad issues that actually affected them and their own lives in the small town they lived in. We read all kinds of current events, from new drinks at Starbucks to the loss of bird species and the effect on the ecosystem.\n\nPersonally, I read through the news daily, and I read articles from a variety of sources to get multiple perspectives. Understanding the current events in the world may not affect my daily life, but it does inform my behavior. For example, when COVID first started in Wuhan, China, I didn't wait for it to start spreading before I stocked up on groceries and other necessities. Instead, I did my emergency supply shopping before Christmas. Then, when the illness spread to the U.S., I didn't have to go out and work my way through crowded grocery stores to get our necessities.\n\n", "path": "./logs/pilot/a6dbae698d8241f0bf892c465a669509.jsonl", "prompt": "Are We Being Bad Citizens If We Don't Keep Up With the News?\n\nIn your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology has a positive influence on dating.  As a single mom, I did not have the luxury of going out regularly to meet new people or date.  If I were going to find a sitter, pay for said sitter, and give my very precious time to someone for a first date, I wanted to make sure this person was vetted. As far as I was concerned, this wasn't even possible until the birth of online dating.  By communicating online, you are able to determine if you have common interests, hobbies, values before you waste a night having awkward conversations only to realize this wasn't the person for you. You can learn a lot about someone and despite Tinder's reputation, you get to know the person behind their profile.\nDo not get me wrong, like every dating experience you go through a lot of toads to find your prince.  With that said, I was able to find my fiance by asking the important questions and getting to know him on a deeper level before we ever actually met in person.  In a relatively short period of time, we were able to get to that place where we knew this was it.  There are some men, and \"catfish,\" that give online a negative reputation for only being a place where people go to find a hook up. However, if you know what you want it is easy to find someone who wants something similar.  In this day and age it is always possible for someone to lie, but by vetting and asking the important questions you are able to eliminate most of the bad eggs.\nI believe these apps help dating.

As a petite woman, this brought me a sense of comfort knowing whether or not the man taking me out had any prior convictions.  I could rest easy before walking into a situation where I felt unsafe.  The only negative aspect I can say exists is the fact that some men say they want a relationship, but truthfully are only looking for a hook up.  However, this is not the fault of the app!

They allow you to meet people without leaving your home, but that is really all they are good for.\n\nTo really get to know a person, and see if they are right for you to continue a relationship with, you need to spend time with them, and in different situations. You need to hold their hand while watching a movie, have an argument with them over something trivial, and experience all sorts of things together. Take them to meet your friends and family. Attend church with them. Go on a picnic. Have the flu and let them take care of you. \n\nIn my opinion, the app is just a way to communicate and find out some information if they are who they say they are. For many, it's really just a way to hook up and get laid. Which is also a really bad way to start a relationship. \n\nI know of some people who have used the app because they are interested in something more than just sex. But every single one of them walked away disillusioned and hurt. The guys they choose to keep in touch with through emailing and texting are the ones that add another girl to the picture.\n\nI have not personally tried the apps. But during a separation that was a year-long, my husband did use the apps. He went on a few dates. He wanted me to try doing the same. I literally laughed and asked if he honestly knew who he was married to. \nI know that if I end up single again, and ready to date, the kind of man I would be looking for isn't going to be on a dating app. He won't be the kind of man who would lie and keep 2 or 3 women on his roster just in case he ends up having to choose one. \n\nTechnology has many valuable uses. It does aid in communication, especially if you are separated by distance.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology has drastically improved the process of dating, even though it has a few flaws. In a good sense, technology has helped people across national boundaries connect more and strengthen relationships, which might have been impossible without it. Apps like Netflix, social media, and texting have helped partners grow their intimacy and spend quality time with each other. However, technology also has its flaws, as it provides an excuse for partners to avoid real-life interactions because they would rather talk online instead of meeting in person. \n\nTechnology\u2019s positive effects are many times more powerful than its negative effects, and it is better to use them wisely in order to prevent issues. While I never had the need to use a dating site, social media has been a great place for me to meet new friends and connect with people outside my background. During the COVID-19 pandemic, technology helped me sustain my long-distance relationship by ensuring continuous communication and real-life interaction through video calls. Technology made it easy for partners to communicate seamlessly with the use of text messaging apps like Facebook and video chat apps. \n\nHowever, many couples had to end their relationship because they failed to use technology wisely when issues arose over the phone. Technology often leads to miscommunication or misinterpretation, which is a major factor that contributes to the end of a relationship. Also, some partners often let their tech apps and social media distract them from giving attention to their partner, which can also limit the intimacy and physical relationship between couples. Finally, there is also the possibility of distrust in a relationship, which can also strain the relationship between couples. \n\nOverall, technology poses both positive and negative effects on relationships and dating, which is why it is important that one is carefully when exploring technology. Technology is here to stay, and this can only mean that people are left with the option to use it properly to avoid issues that can affect their love life and relationship.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, there are upsides and downsides when it comes to dating apps. I have had positive outcomes with dating apps because they allow the user to chose people who meet specific attributes. However, they can also produce an unrealistic expectation about what people are seeking in a relationship. Most people oversell their attributes and once you meet then in person they fail to meet the expectations. One key benefit of dating apps is convenience. It only takes a few minutes to meet and greet with someone completely new. One can go through an individuals profile and chat with him or her without the cumbersome process of meeting in person and getting disappointed. \nTechnology has made it easier for people to access programming that they like through applications such as Netflix that use an algorithm that provides content based on what one has watched. There is also the benefit of not missing out on the content because it is accessible at any anytime and from anywhere. On the other hand, social media and texting allow people to express themselves especially of they are introverts. They also offer an array of ways to communicate that makes a relationship fun and exciting. For example, there are emojis that allow one to share the way he or she feels.  Such attributes of social media make the interactions of partners more exciting and fun.\nRomantic interactions have improved because one can curate everything from the communication to images and videos of the entire encounter. Such benefits were not observed before such technology and people would only have letters and very view pictures of their relationship. Therefore, the improvement of technology to include social media and texting is important for a relationship. Besides, social media platforms such as YouTube have allowed couples to share their routine life. Normally, such platforms are mostly used for businesses and organizations but once in a while they allow couples to record their video on the activities done. They can also earn money from just sharing their everyday life. \nHowever, there is a dark side of social media that includes fake identities used to lure innocent users. Such issues happen because there are many people that use the disguise of being someone they are not. For example, there have been cases of people being swindled using the Tinder app that is a popular dating app for adults. Some people use the disguise to make victims believe they have fallen in love. In the end, they gain access to their finances and steal them. There is also the issue of child pornography. Such issues have been discovered because there are some people that use the apps to lure poor helpless children. Overall, the emergence of dating apps, Netflix, social media and texting has enhanced romantic relationships, but one needs to be cautious when using such innovations.

You can just randomly message someone, and I think that social media has made talking to other people in general so much easier. Even if you don't message someone, everyone is so much more accessible on social media.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that social media has also made things more complicated. You can have so much access to people and lots of different people at once, which can be overwhelming. I think that having all this access to everyone's \"lives\" on social media can skew our perception of reality and what is healthy and normal. You can spend all this time comparing yourself to other people's highlights on social media, or viewing how many likes they got on their most recent post, when in reality, people only put their best online, never their worst. Some people tend to forget that and get so caught up in unrealistic expectations, even in relationships. \n\nI also think that technology can sometimes act as a distraction and prevent people who are in relationships from spending quality time with their significant others.

I think that sometimes technology can be a crutch or get in the way of face-to-face communication, making it harder for people to communicate. Communication is really important in relationships, and you really need to make sure that your partner knows how you feel about them and not just see how invested in technology you are.\n\nIn terms of romantic interactions, I think technology can be good for inspiring others to do better for their significant others, but with that, it can also lead to unrealistic expectations. Seeing someone posts flowers every other day from their significant other, meanwhile the reality was that they were received once a month, can give people unrealistic expectations. People are so quick to compare their relationships and their lives to others, forgetting that social media is an illusion.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion,\n\nThere is no conceivable way for technology to exist and not affect dating, while impacting all of our other experiences from parenting, schooling, banking, even buying groceries. Today, technology and dating has become for many, synonymous. Dating apps and dating sites have multiplied to the point where even if you don't utilize one, you know someone who currently does. According to Statista, 34% of Americans have used an online dating site or app and 55% of these relationships have led to marriage. There's no disputing the fact that with technology, men and women alike have access to more dating opportunities than ever in history. However, for all the benefits of accessibility given to those looking for love through technology, there are just as many, if not more drawbacks.\n\nFor starters, although Statista reports more than half of online relationships leading to marriage, about half of all marriages end in the divorce. And though people have more access to suitors than ever before in history, men and women are reporting higher levels of loneliness. Moreover, within the apps, most often women have a much easier time finding matches than men. This is especially true for males with average or less than average looks. In other words, if he looks unimpressive and has an average bank account, simply putting up a profile may not amount to much success. Dating apps and sites increase everyone's accessibility, but they haven't turned out to make us any happier, or make our marriages last any longer. Knowing all of this, you might be wondering why people continue to use them.\n\nTalking face-to-face is a skill that's become a lost art in our culture. Rather than in-person conversations, we opt for more comfortable, but more impersonal ways of communication. We all know that actually meeting and interacting with a potential mate face-to-face is important, but we don't always know how. We don't want to offend, scare, or intimidate him/her. Nor do we want to be disappointed with the investment we have made or be rejected. We are much more comfortable with the anonymity of cyber space. However, the only way to build a skill is to cultivate said skill.

{"essay": "\n      In my opinion, technology can strengthen relationships dependent on how it is used. An example of this is when two people are in a long-distance relationship, technology can help to stay connected and foster communication. Communicating via phone, communication fosters and strengthens the relationship. \n     Now, while relationships can be strengthened by relationships, they can be hindered by technology as well. Often, technology does not replace in-person bonding time. Many people rely on physical touch in order to bond with their partner. Another negative of technology with dating is the fact that most instances of cheating are initiated by an app. \n     Personally, I feel that when used responsibly, technology can add an additional layer of connection between two people. I met my current partner on a romantic website. In fact, many couples meet each other online through some type of application, website, or social media platform. Generation Z is so acquitted with the internet that it is no surprise that online dating has become popular among this demographic. Additionally, with the pandemic restricting in-person meetings, many people have been forced to get creative in terms of communication and technology has been a great tool during these times. \n     I think that technology is pertinent to our current society in staying in touch with our loved ones.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology has both improved and worsened romantic interactions. On the one hand, technology has made it a lot easier to stay in touch with potential romantic partners and reach out to them. On the other hand, social media has made exacerbated hook-up culture and made people take relationships less seriously.\n\nIn my experience with dating apps, very few people are actually using them for their intended use of finding a long-term romantic partner, myself included. The vast majority of college-age users have no intention of actually meeting up with anyone off of the apps and just use them as a game, once again myself included. While this can be fun, it could make people take relationships less seriously than they should.\n\nI believe this could be because a lot of college-age people don't really care about getting into a serious relationship as well as not wanting to meet their partner on a dating app. There are also many concerns about meeting up with someone you don't know off the internet regardless of how long you have been texting. One, they could be a catfish, two they could be violent, or three they could just be incredibly awkward in person.\n\nAs earlier mentioned, technology has made it easier to keep in contact with someone you met. Forget to ask for their number? Just search for their name on social media and you can start talking. In the past, if you forgot to ask someone for their number, you would just have to hope that you will run into them again at some point in the future. Now, you can much more easily re-connect with a person that you\u2019re interested in.\n\nHowever, that very thing that makes it easier to stay in contact with people makes it less likely that you'll go on dates. In the past, if you were interested in someone, the only way you could talk more is by going on a date. But now, if you want to talk you can simply start talking over Instagram and Snapchat rendering dates less necessary and less likely to happen. \n\nTraditional dating itself is made significantly more stressful for young people by the internet and social media. With social media, it can often appear that everyone is in a relationship. However, the truth is often far from that. People love to post pictures of their dinners and vacations, but they rarely mention all the times that they didn't get a call back after a first date. \n\nSocial media has also raised most people's standards to an unrealistic point. Seeing all the extremely attractive famous people on media sites has made the average person think they deserve the very best-looking and acting person of all time.  This unrealistic standard puts people in the mindset that they deserve anything and everything out of a relationship, and that if they aren\u2019t getting what they want they should leave.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, technology doesn't generally make things worse or better, it merely amplifies what was already there. Apps, for example, do not suddenly create racism or superficiality. But it lets racists find each other, and speak loudly about things many people try to insist are relics of the past. I think the same goes for dating. People have always been superficial, flighty, and insecure. Things like YouTube, Twitter, and Tinder have only made us more aware of the ways these people live: posting about how proud they are to have cheated, strung dates along, and the oddly specific list demands they have for their prospective partners.  Infidelity and disinterest always happened; we just didn't have our every misstep documented independently on someone's phone. There have always been cheaters, psychos, and predators. The internet has just given them a mask to hide behind in order to hurt more people.\n\nOne specific way I think the internet does make things worse is it can act as a live receipt of everything someone has ever done. And in an age of forced personal responsibility, it's easier to find past sins and harder to forgive them. The stupid thing you did in college may be ultimately inconsequential, but if you or a friend post about it, years later a potential partner can find it and take it as evidence that you would be a bad choice. And with a wealth of other options showcased online, it can be easier for them to kick you to the curb for the promise of an idea of something slightly better. \n\nTexting, on the other hand, can be a curse and a blessing. While it gives people the ability to always be in contact with each other, it also unfortunately gives people the ability to always be in contact with each other.   The endless \"Hey U Up?\", the frantic paranoia when they don't text back right away, the agonizing dilemma of whether or not to text back right away, the realization that whatever you text will be preserved in perpetuity for them to analyze and criticize at their leisure. But again, the argument can be made that texting does not create these problems, it just emphasizes our human desire to cling to an illusion of control. \n\nPeople have always had and will continue to have insecurities, anger issues, and lapses in judgment.

Some people, after all, have visual or auditory impairments, which means that the best option for one may not necessarily even be an option for another. The wide availability of multiple forms of media consumption is a wonderful development in the world of reading (or listening!), and I am grateful to have both as an option. That said, I prefer reading books in the traditional manner and have not listened to an audiobook since I was a kid. \n\nBenefits to listening over reading include the ability to move or do other tasks while consuming material, an added layer of theatricality and feeling derived from the speaker's vocal performance, and ease of storing, transporting, and accessing books. The first benefit is most persuasive to me, who has a hard time sitting still and focusing when completing one activity. The ability to listen to a book while doing chores, painting, or taking a walk/road trip is huge\u2014however, when it comes to listening, I would still much prefer to listen to music than a book while doing any of these things. The added perk of having a story read to you by a professional isn't negligble; however, I find that the inflection of an individual reduces the impact of a reading experience and doesn't add enough to the listening equivalent. Similarly, while it's nice not to have to carry a book around while traveling, the aesthetic presence of a physical book can be valuable in and of itself, providing a layer to the reading experience that can't be attained by opening one's ears.\n\nFor these reasons, I much prefer reading over listening. When reading, I can go at my own pace, digest and process material in between sentences, annotate and inject my own thoughts directly onto the lines themselves, and skip around easily. I can examine a page as much and as long as I like, allowing myself to be transported to and absorbed in the world of the story. Physical books are sensually wonderful, with beautiful covers, pleasantly tactile pages, and a lifetime of physical artifacts to accompany my experience with that particular book. On the personal cognition level, I also just process language better when it comes through my eyes rather than ears. Audiobook readers often don't read quickly or slowly enough, and when reading a book, I have the privilege to skim past boring sections and dwell on or re-read interesting ones.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I feel that this argument is largely determined by personal taste. No one can deny that reading is good but preference remains an important bias. I listen to audiobooks as they come with a lot of benefits. However, there are times I prefer to read my books to listening to audiobooks. \nThe advantages of audiobooks include that you can listen to them anywhere at any time, you can listen to a book regardless of your pace, you don't need a light to read the book, you do not have to worry about turning, folding or expanding the book, you can listen to a story in your favorite language and you need not take notes on what to read, and you can multitask while listening to the audio book. \nThe only advantage of reading over audiobook is one's attitude. It is easy to be lackadaisical and unserious because you are listening. You want to do other things while listening. However, reading will require your full attention as you cannot engage in other things.  \nIn the same vein, it might not be an advisable option if we consider the health implication on the ears. A lot of people are affected by the auditory hallucination due to listening to the loud sound for a long time, or you can have difficulty hearing. The human ears should listen to just 60 decibels but being in a noisy environment may mean one has to increase the sound of the audiobook. Doing this for a long time puts one's ears at risk. \nFurthermore, while reading, one can EASILY underline, highlight and make notes on what to read and what not to in the book. You can bookmark with your audiobooks but it cannot be as effective for retention as found in reading. Hence, reading has a more serious approach and can be perfect for preparing for examinations. \nFor me, I am fine with both audiobooks and reading, depending on the situation. If I am in a situation where I need utmost attention, maybe preparation for an exam, I opt for reading. I need all the attention in the world but using my gadget to listen might be distracting. I may be tempted to use social media or surf the internet for other reasons. \nHowever, audiobooks are a valid preference when I have a lot of activities to do. Since it is refreshing, I can multitask and do a lot of things without sacrificing my attention. Also, it is easy to keep up with the latest version of the document and not wait till it is published or available in bookshops. You can easily subscribe to the publisher's mail and receive the audiobooks as they are available.\nIn conclusion, audiobooks are a great option but only if you are mature enough to use them. Also, it is dependent on the activity one is doing and it has to be evaluated with what suits you. Whichever choice you make, do not despise reading.

{"essay": "\nI am a large proponent of audiobooks. I think the misleading way many people think about audiobooks, however, is that they think they should be compared to regular books. This, I feel, is the wrong way to look at audiobooks. Instead, I see audiobooks as a different way to consume content. I would not be able to consume nearly as many books as I do if it weren't for audiobooks, mainly because there just isn't always an opportunity to read a physical book in a given situation. During a commute, for example, it would be impossible for me to read a physical book, but it's incredibly easy to listen to an audiobook. \n\nThat said, I do think there are benefits to reading physical books that are difficult to find in reading an audiobook. One such benefit is the active engagement that comes with reading. When reading a physical book, or at least when I am reading a physical book, I know that I am reading every line, every word. Even if it's a word I don't know, I'm forced to engage with it. As opposed to an audiobook, where it's much easier to simply move on if you come across a particularly tough word or passage. With audiobooks, it's easier to passively move forward. Additionally, and I don't have any hard evidence of this other than anecdotal, reading a physical book feels more mentally engaging. Forcing yourself to use your inner voice and actively move your eyes across the page requires you to be more mentally engaged in what you are reading than simply pushing a button to continue listening. One other element is the performative nature of an audiobook. Many audiobook narrators incorporate their own performances of different characters' voices or mannerisms, which is fantastic to listen to, but it also prevents you from being able to use your imagination to make those same characters come to life on your own. \n\nAll things considered, I think there is a time and place for both methods of \"reading.\" I think it is largely inappropriate to try to quantify whether one is better--both have advantages and disadvantages. I think reading a physical book requires more investment of time and mental energy than an audiobook, but there are advantages that come with an audiobook, like the added convenience and ability to consume content more quickly. If forced to pick one over the other, I would say I prefer reading a physical book, all else being equal, for the reason I mentioned above about being able to stimulate your imagination and let it create the world of the book for you", "path": "./logs/pilot/a3c7112b22cb43e58a3cdccc2ba938d7.jsonl", "prompt": "Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?\n\nDo you listen to audiobooks?

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, the effectiveness of listening to audiobooks depends entirely on what type of learner the listener is. Visual learners such as myself would struggle with it. However, Auditory learners would excel. For a visual learner such as myself, I want to see the words on the page as it helps me to stay focused.\n\nPersonally, I have found myself most engaged when listening to an audiobook and reading a physical copy of a book at the same time. It helps to keep my mind from wandering and keeps my focus on the book. I have also found that it helps my retention of information. \n\nDespite this, listening to audiobooks alone does yield certain advantages. For example, you can multitask whilst listening. Listeners can cook dinner, go on a walk, get work done, or be driving in their car and enjoy consuming literature. This is in stark contrast to reading a physical copy of a book, which readers have to just read and cannot be doing anything else. \n\nAnother advantage of listening to audiobooks is that thousands and thousands of audiobooks are available for free online while it can be difficult or impossible to get a free physical copy of a book to read. Audiobooks' availability online also means that a person can start listening anywhere so long as they have internet access. However, readers who prefer a physical copy have to wait until they get home, to a library, or remember to lug their books around with them everywhere they go. \n\nThis ease with which audiobooks can be accessed can also encourage listeners to listen to more books. This is because people tend to give up on reading because they don't have the time but listening to an audiobook can easily be added to their schedule. This not only encourages listeners to listen to (and thus read) more books but also to find new genres than they normally would have done. \n\nA slight advantage physical copies have over audiobooks is the ability to see the structure and punctuation of a story. This does not always contribute to the story but depending on the author it can. While this may seem a small detail, some readers would definitely miss it.  \n\nAnother slight advantage physical copies have is that readers can easily flip back in the book to read something they forgot while it can be hard to pinpoint which part of the story to scroll back to in an audiobook. Although audiobooks do have various features to help with this such as rewinding and repeating, it is not as effective as flipping back and forth in my opinion.\n\nNow, which way is better depends entirely on the individual reader. Both ways of absorbing literature have their merits and drawbacks. Ultimately, it is entirely up to the reader to what style they prefer.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, listening to a book grants the same benefits of reading a book in person. However, the method by which a book is read or listened to allows for different types of reading experiences. When you listen to a book, you can get easily distracted or you will be less focused. But when you are reading a book, you are forced to focus on the contents of the book as you need to focus to actually understand the book. This limits the ability to get distracted on other things as when you are focused on reading the words from the book. Reading the words of a book already takes a lot of focus so you can understand the meaning of each word and help you take in the information of the book. \n\nSimilarly, when you listen to an audiobook, you do not have to focus on comprehending the book as much. For others, although this may mean they might not be as focused, they will feel better as they do not have to take as much effort to understand the book if they are able to avoid distractions. When listening to a book, you will also have additional features that cannot be attained from reading a physical book. You will be able to pause the audiobook being played or even listen to it at higher speeds as well. Since it is possible to listen at higher speeds, you can just enjoy the sound of a book without needing to have to read and understand everything. Also, for instance, if you do not enjoy reading because it takes too much effort and want to listen to the book instead, you can simply listen at different voices to add more fun. This also means that instead of having to focus on understanding the book, you can just zone out and enjoy the sound of different readers as well.\n\nConversely, there will be some disadvantages of listening to an audio book versus to reading a physical book. First, for some students, listening to a book is less of a commitment to read it. They might believe that listening to the book is enough but they will neglecting the importance of actually reading the book. They also may not understand the material as well because they often forget to read the book with context. Since the book is not being read with your own eyes, you do not have to put in as much effort as if you were reading the physical book. If you do not put in enough effort and comprehension, this can lead to problems when it comes to understanding the information and putting it into use. Secondly, the ability to listen and move around more while listening to a book can lead to you losing focus more. You might end up allowing yourself to get distracted or do something else instead of focusing on the book that is being read. This can lead to a bigger issue in terms of understanding the material being read.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, excessive screen use during the pandemic was a stop gap, and even though we have transitioned out of the early and middle days of the pandemic with our bad screen habits, the drawbacks of having our faces glued to the ubiquitous incandescent screen haven't subsided or disappeared. Aside from how looking at screens affects our moods, especially for children, there are other biological reasons why excessive screen time is still bad.\n\nFor one, the glowing boxes we stare at all day have a detrimental effect on our melatonin production, which both children and adults need. Melatonin is one of the body's most important and vital hormones \u2013 without and its production sleeping is hard, if not impossible. For adults, sleep affects our mood, weight, mental acuity, and even sanity. For children, the same but they're also developing and growing, and sleep is even more important in the endeavor of growing up. \n\nFor older kids, the excess screen time, while not as detrimental to their physical development (unless they're living completely sedentary lives), affects their mental well-being. It's no secret that the more tweens and teens spend on online, the worse their mental health outcomes. Screen time has been linked to depression and it even interferes in the kind of relationships they have. And, the loneliness factor of online life is well-documented, but as research states, social media also directly correlates to higher levels of depression and even suicide attempts.\n\nWhile many everyday people, especially parents, try to navigate screen time and smart technology and the exponential drawbacks it can have on their developing children, the ultra wealthy \u2013 silicon valley tech developers \u2013 have separated themselves, and their children from screens. For every several stories about the risks and dangers of excessive screen time for younger people, especially, tween and teen girls, there's one about how some celebrity or silicon valley engineer doesn't let their kids have smartphones, for example. Or they limit screen time in a way that reduces the risks of over using it. \n\nFor everyone, but especially adults, we only need look how the sociocultural landscape has changed as smart technology has gotten smarter and increased our interactions with literally everyone all the time. The hostile, aggressive behavior we utilize in our online discussions has long since made it out into IRL, which has not benefited anyone.  The toxicity of our political landscape is directly affected by online culture; or to put it in terms of the original question, the more time our eyeballs sit in front of a screen the nastier we are.\n\nThey great irony, here, is that the people who created this technology to be irresistible to humans, have distanced themselves from and endeavor to limit use.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, screen time is a problem, and it is not receiving the attention from the public health field that it should. During the pandemic, we all leaned more heavily into our screens for work, socialization and everything in between. This reliance on technology definitely changed our daily routines, and there is no going back. It's hard to argue against it because of their undoubted benefits. More time at home because of less commute, better access to high quality instructional videos on the internet, the list is endless. People quickly got used to using their devices for basic daily tasks that were once performed in person. \n\nBut, one of the key points in public health concerns about screen use is whether they are undermining sociality and connectivity. When we are overexposed to screens, we are not learning how to engage with each other face-to-face. A zoom meeting always happens with an agenda, we no longer have those impromptu discussions which fueled a lot of creative ideation. You may not notice this right away, but after a while you realize how much conversation and discussion has been lost. Those small inside jokes which made our days happier are lost, or rather they are never even found any more.\n\nAs a result, it is hard not to wonder if the screen limits our ability to be present in our own lives, and therefore diminishes the opportunity for all of us to live out our lives to the fullest. This is not even to mention the associations of excessive screen with attention deficit disorders, health issues with bones and such.

When you are trapped inside your home for several months, or even a few years, you're definitely going to expect humans adapting to another thing that will keep them not bored. They can use this new thing in different ways, provided if they're not addicted to it; if that's the case, then they must learn how to use it effectively in their everyday life.\n\nThere's no questioning the benefits that technology can bring by being able to check or use your smartphone or laptop for anything even when it's fully portable everywhere you go. And it will be an important tool to have during your self-isolation compared to the useless newspaper that you would normally read every morning. I don't see a problem with people using their smartphones because it is not physically harmful himself or the people around him. Especially during the pandemic, we needed some life-changing technology in such a difficult time. Right now, is that time where people can use their smartphones to get information or news content, or partly work as an office because you have internet. It also provides a way for families to talk to each other in person every day, or even voice messages and videos.  And for the critics who say that we should not be using our smartphones and computer because it will kill us humans, then I'm honestly sorry because they are thinking too much on the topic. Because the benefits it can offer will definitely help us bypass through a hard time like what is going on right now in Saudi Arabia, and also countries experiencing other crises and disasters. So, I hope the criticism will think carefully and realize that they are wrong in thinking that smartphones are going to destroy people's mind.\n\nAll in all, we should not be worried about excessive screen time right now as it has already adapted to our everyday lives and proved to be very useful. It is in the national interest to embrace this new innovation, instead of fearing it. After all, our screen time is something that we cannot help but to embrace.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, mindfulness is a very important skill that should be learned very early on in life. Mindfulness helps you to focus on what's happening around you, as well as yourself, and can lead to much better decision-making later in life. In younger people, mindfulness can be very helpful in developing good interpersonal skills with others, and for closing oneself off from distractions so they can excel academically. \nIt is a wholesome process that allows one to reflect on things, which in turn allows you to make less impulsive decisions.\n\nI have had reason to practice mindfulness, and I must say that I have found it very useful. Not only did it help me cope with my feelings, but it also made me more aware of myself and the world around me. In a world where people are not so conscious about what is happening around them, mindfulness helps get people to be more conscious, which I believe we can all benefit from. \n\nOne of the things the world evidently needs is greater empathy for our fellow human beings, and mindfulness is an excellent way to make this happy. I believe strongly that mindfulness should be taught in schools, and I also believe that it can be done without taking away from any other subject. This is because mindful techniques can be implemented into almost everything, and will help greatly with focus on school work. \n\nAlso, implementing mindfulness into schools' curricula can help to reduce bullying, since it would be much more difficult to be mean to others if you were mindful. Imagine how great schools will be if students do not have to worry about bullying. Having students that are aware of their environment, and who have greater empathy and love for their fellow human beings will better society as a whole. It will additionally make our school system feel more inclusive, create really great kids, and give teachers more time to teach, rather than referee fights.\n\nIntroducing children to self-awareness and mindfulness early enough may help prevent them from developing negative mental health problems as they grow up. This is very important considering the prevalent nature of mental health problems among adolescents and children. In the last few years, we have seen the impact of negative mental health on other people, and we have been left to wonder how it got that bad as well as the question of how to fix it.\n\nUnfortunately, children are not left out of this problem, as a good many of them face their own struggles with mental health. Studies have shown that 20 million American children or younger aged 3 - 17, are suffering from some kind of mental health problem (The Great Lakes Center for Education Research & Practice). It also shows that 75 percent of the people who do experience mental health problems have symptoms before the age of 14. This is a rather sad finding as children are meant to be innocent and carefree, but with this kind of statistics, it has become quite clear that they are not as free from mental health problems as we ar.\n\nHence, the need to fiercely protect them and give them the childhood and even adulthood they deserve. This can be done by introducing and encouraging them to set healthy limits as early as possible, and that will be brought out by the introduction of mindfulness in schools.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I do think it would be beneficial for children to practice mindfulness in school. I believe that a good understanding of mindfulness can help children (and adults) gain greater self-awareness. I also think that mindfulness can help children to develop emotional regulation, an ability that is not always mastered (particularly during the elementary years). As children, our emotions often feel very overwhelming because we do not have the vocabulary to verbalize what we are feeling. By teaching children how to take a moment to calm down and become present in their body - they can begin to practice putting words to what they are feeling. \n\nMindfulness is also very appealing to teach within the classroom because it lends itself to (and can be integrated within) a number of different subjects. Mindfulness practices can help children in academic areas like reading and writing by getting them to slow down and focus on sounding out each word as they are reading it. It can also help children pay attention to their bodies while they are working out complex math equations or doing a physical education activity. Mindfulness can also help children who are struggling with social/emotional skills to gain a greater perspective on themselves, their classmates, and their relationships.\n\nOverall, I think the benefits of teaching children mindfulness practices in school outweigh any negative effects.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, they should not teach this at school as it maybe against some family's beliefs and religions. They should let the families decide what to teach their children in this area. They can ask for the ask for the parent's consent of this if they would like to teach this to their children or not. In my opinion, I think children should not be taught it at school unless their families want them to learn it too because it may also be too hard for children to learn at such a young age where they are most likely to get distracted and not be able to focus on such spiritual matters.\n\nAt such a young age, children are used to being a lot more energetic and will most likely not even be able to sit in one spot for such a time. Also, the children will most likely be asked to do this many times over a short period of time which may get annoying for the children in question. They will most likely want to go outside instead or have more adventurous activities then sitting in one spot trying to focus on one thing. They are young and they need to enjoy themselves and not have to sit in one spot for a long time being forced to focus on things they do not understand. Even if you do get them to try to acknowledge these spiritual things, they will have no idea what it means or what they should do with it. \n\nOverall, trying to get kids to understand and realize such spiritual things is very difficult. One time in elementary school, we tried meditation from a guest from school. The only problem is that there were too many distractions and people were talking and laughing together which was not helping our needs to roam around and cure our boredom. However, it is still ok for children to know what mindfulness and meditation are in case they wish to practice such things on their own time. It is just that this will be too difficult in a school setting where there are many other influences and distractions in place.\n\nAt conclusion, if you would like to teach your children meditation and other spiritual matters, it is better to do it at home where you can focus on one child and where you will better understand your child. The children will then be able to listen better and focus on you when they need help in this area. Also, teachers should not be allowed to tell kids how to live their lives and what they can or cannot do. It is better to allow the parents to teach their children such things and not risk getting in their business or trying to educate them in this matter without any consent.

I believe that schools should teach mindfulness in schools because it will positively impact on student's overall performance and behaviors within and outside the school settings. \n\nMindfulness is a mental state where one\u2019s attention is centered on any encounter that gives the person an opportunity to learn, grow, and become. Students who have learned about mindfulness often tend to handle stressful situations like exams calmly, as it allows them to focus on the moment and regulate their emotions. By teaching mindfulness in schools, students can learn to engage in practices that are vital for managing stress and improving their performance at school, especially through meditation and yoga. Mindfulness instruction from teachers can help boost the attention span of students and help them create a stress coping mechanism that will help them all their lives. \n\nWhile mindfulness can be learned outside of school, I believe that it should be available in schools because students need to learn the act of self-control and stress management to properly focus on their studies. In addition, mindfulness should be taught in schools by providing teachers with enough time to engage students in mindfulness practices because this will create a safe space for mindfulness practices that will enhance the general culture and behavior of every student. On the other hand, some would argue that school-based mindfulness has often been proven less effective for the well-being and mental health of students, but this isn't true.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, I believe that schools should teach mindfulness. Personally, I have tried meditation and it has had positive effects in the way I handle my worry by allowing me to center on the actions I can handle presently. Then if I feel my worry beginning to flare up again, I can redirect my thoughts once more. Such an approach has been crucial in my productivity and ability to be able to focus on both carefully analyzing the variety of options I have while also thinking about large, abstract goals. As a result, of my positive experiences with meditation, I believe that schools need to embrace such practices and include them in the curriculum. \nOne of the reasons I believe that schools should embrace mindfulness or meditation is because handling the school environment can result to anxiety and other stresses that affect the student. For example, students could feel overwhelmed with the sheer amount of homework or exams that pile up quickly due to the limited time to complete each project. Such challenges create a scenario where the students need to be empowered with skills to know how to handle their work without loosing their mind. Meditation offers an excellent remedy of handling their issues and also offers them with a new perspective regarding what is required from them. \nMeditation has always been part of the human race. It has been thought of as a practice to obtain mental strength, while also helping people understand multiple concepts. Similarly, in schools where there are numerous concepts that one has to learn, the students need to understand ways they can comprehend the ideas without being fully assisted. Meditation is a tool that students can use by themselves and integrate in their lives in practical ways even after they leave school. As a result, meditation can help the students with their academic goals, beyond just learning more about specialized subjects.\nSadly, some schools look down or at least disregard the idea of incorporating meditation in their curriculum. The reason for such assumptions regarding meditation is because of the religious connection that the practice has. Specifically, meditation has Buddhist roots which might make people feel uncomfortable about the practices. Therefore, even though mindfulness and meditation have demonstrated their effectiveness there are still major obstacles that the education fraternity needs to overcome before the practice can be part of the curriculum. However, as schools start to have more options with how to educate their students, it is important that they keep up with the changing times. To do so there is need for involvement of stakeholders and sharing the benefits that are associated with meditation in the schools.

{"essay": "\nIn my opinion, mindfulness has a place in schools and it should be encouraged for everyone, young and old. My personal experience with meditation and yoga began much later, but the benefits I see in myself are so great that I think everyone would be advised to start as soon as they can. I can only see positives with starting early. \n\nIn a world that is extremely fast and anxious and punishing. our kids need to be equipped with the tools to cope with what life throws at them. That's what school is all about. So, I would say brain based tools and practices such as mindfulness should be a part of school curriculums. The practice of these techniques is a lifelong venture. As a result, learning early on can make our kids more proficient as they begin their emotional development. Sometimes kids don't know how to cope with emotions and often react in a negative manner causing others to feel negatively towards them. If we teach them tools to deal with your emotions and the negative or positive surrounding that emotion they will be better prepared. This is why I think introducing mindfulness is critical. \n\nI am not advocating for mindfulness at the cost of the traditional curriculum. Rather, I am suggesting another tool for teachers to use when making lesson plans that have a positive impact on helping children develop into wholesome and productive adults. I understand the challenges of course. We cannot expect our poor underfunded school teachers to also now develop and impart another form of expertise. It will take a strong effort by the government and the public to get involved in this and that takes time. But I think the benefits will be there for all to see. \n", "path": "./logs/pilot/0361c0a94e0c49beb9f525daafca00ef.jsonl", "prompt": "Should Schools Teach Mindfulness?\n\nHave you ever tried mindfulness or meditation, practices that focus on the present moment and being aware of your thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations?
